Package Contents 



The DunjonMasters here at Epyx have decreed that each special computer sys- 
tem package contain everything you need to enjoy and fully appreciate the rich 
and terrifying fantasy adventure the Temple Trilogy's three realms have in store: 
The Temple of Apshai, The Upper Reaches of Apshai and the Curse of Ra. 

► Game Disk: Contains the three Temple of Apshai Trilogy computer adven- 
tures : The Temple of Apshai, the Upper Reaches of Apshai and the Curse of 
Ra. If you purchased a Commodore/Atari version, each side of the disk 
contains a complete version of the game for each computer system. Side I 
is for the Commodore and Side 2 is for the Atari. 

► Apshai Command Card: The Apshai Command Card provides you with a 
handy "at-a-glance" reference card of all the special Commands for 
moving, fighting and looting treasure in the three Trilogy realms. In addi- 
tion, the Command Card also offers special joystick and mouse control in- 
structions for the computer system indicated on the card. 

► The Book of Apshai: This Book of Apshai offers a complete testament of 
legends, lore and fascinating background information on the classic Temple 
of Apshai Tribgy. Here you will find step-by-step instructions for quickly 
mastering the "Rules of Apshai." The "Thirteen Ways to Staying Healthy" 
reveals secret teachings and advice on surviving in the dungeons. And the 
chilling "Oracle of Apshai" calls forth adventurers of every realm to destroy 
the evil power of the Curse of Ra. You'll also find complete detailed 
descriptions of each room and Level within the three Trilogy realms — all 
568 of them to be exact — in "The Scrolls of Apshai. " The Book of Apshai 
offers you, the serious adventurer, a complete testament of fantasy. 

► IBM or Macintosh Apshai Guide: If you purchased an IBM PC or Apple 
Macintosh version, a special "handbook" has been included that will con- 
tain important operating system and game play instructions. 



The Oracle 
of Apshai 



The Sphinx is drowsy, 

Her wings are furled: 



"Who'll tell me my secret. 
The ages have kept? 



Her ear is heavy, 

She broods on the world. 



I awaited the seer 

While they slumbered and slept . . . 



— Ralph Waldo Emerson 




You are a lone adventurer, strong of sinew and keen of blade and mind. Your 
senses must be sharp as the talons of an eagle, to warn you of swift dangers. 
You must be strong. Only the stoutest of constitutions will stand against the 
rigors of the journey that lies ahead. Yet, you must be subtle. Only a deep mind 
can fathom the mysteries to be unfolded. Sometimes, when strength falters, 
only sleight of hand will save you. 

Yet all will not be darkness. At times your quick wit with a wandering 
monster or cleverness in parlay with the Innkeeper will greatly advance your 
course. Such is intelligence. Logic will also be indispensable to you. 

In the end, when all visible resources are depleted, you will fall back upon 
ego — the well of the self which is man's last reserve. 

I could tell you tales of horror and madness, but this would not serve. The 
Trilogy of Apshai, like truth and beauty, cannot be told. You must experience to 
know. The ear is to listen, the heart is to feel, the soul is to know. These three 
are the simple truths of Apshai. 

So the realms of Apshai are three: first, the Temple; second, the Upper 
Reaches; and last, The Curse of Ra. Of these three I can only say that the first is 
a depth of blackness — its evil power lashes viciously at those who dare to enter 
its very heart. To survive, your war-like spirit must be raised to a fever pitch. 
The second knows tragedy, and the sage laugh that turns away from terror and 
horror. It also knows the path of the spirit, shown by the priests. And the third 
is a place of blinding sand and mazy rooms which are the sancturary of the 
Sphinx — the spirit, the last mystery. 

To fight or flee, such will be your dilemma in the Temple of Apshai. It's said 
the Minotaur of Crete knew of such mazes. Therein you will meet creatures 
hard and soft — carrion beasts and the foul leech. Therein, it is said, lie gems of 
many colors, and healers such as the lilly. Of the friends you meet, natural and 
unnatural, some may help you on your way. You can speak with some of them 
in this place of many tongues.

"No cross, no crown" was said by the religious in ancient times. The price of 
glory is pain. Your mark of courage will be your body, laced with wounds and 
battered by blows. You will need salves and elixirs to heal yourself after 
combatting the monsters of the Temple. 

Within the Apshai Temple there is a compression of experience. Time seems 
to slow as you tread the massive halls, their sheer number presenting a veil to 
the senses. Then a creature lunges at you, and time stops. For this realm, 
sharpen your sword well. Gather treasure, but know that the journey to the 
Altar of Ra, in the third realm, is long. 

After the eternal horrors of the Temple, you will seek respite in the second 
realm, the Upper Reaches. You will still find struggle, but it will wear a different 
face, of both comedy and tragedy. Instead of blood on monsters you'll find 
ketchup on a chicken. Can the Gods be crazy, or are they laughing at you? The 
effort of combat will now bring you to your knees, as you struggle onward. 

In the Upper Reaches you will find "Benedic's Monastery," and "Merlis the 
Mage." These places of prayer and magic spells may help show you the way. 
You will find old bones which lay where they fell, daggers still clutched in 
skinless hands. 

Here, the tearing of limbs by rabid monsters has left spirits crazed in the 
night. The dead cannot sleep and the living cannot awaken from their 
nightmares. The simple souls who sought to strive and gain are now caught in 
eternal anguish. 

Many before you welcomed death by flame, by sword, by sand. But you must 
go onward into the third realm, The Curse of Ra. 

How long can you endure? This you will know in the third realm. Here is a 
place where wealth of the senses is transcended by a greater importance. For, it 
is said, only the Secret of Ra can relieve the curse that afflicts those here on 
land. 

You will pass the "Well of Forever." You will meet creatures of the desert- 
— scorpions, jackals, the dust wraith. Sand storms will dim the glitter of 
diamonds. Beyond the Sphinx is the Pyramid. 

When your travail is greatest, think of Ozymandias: 



I met a traveler from an antique land 

Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone 
Stand in the desert . . . Near them, in the sand, 

Half sunk, a shattered visage lies . . . 

And on the pedestal these words appear: 

"My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings. 

Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!" 

Nothing beside remains. Round the decay 

of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare 

The lone and level sands stretch far away. 

— Percy Bysshe Shelley

But, no grip of hand is surety against every terror, or poison. The truest heart 
may fail when it sees the blackness of the dungeon, or itself. 

All that lies before you cannot be foretold, even by the Oracle. I can tell 
you that the greatest adventure lies not in the din of sword on shield, or in the 
rapacious hoard of silver and diamond. Nor in the gleam of distant sunsets, or 
the firm visage of mailed warriors who guard ancient kingdoms. It lies within. 
Within Apshai. Within you. 

I knew. The quest was to begin.

Adventurer 



Five Steps to the Gates of Apshai 

Once you've properly loaded The Temple of Apshai Trilogy disk, the time has come 
for you to set out upon your personal fantasy adventure into the fabled dungeons of 
Apshai. 

1 Select a Character: The Innkeeper menu screen will 
appear first. Have the "Innkeeper" select a character for 
you. Select C> from the menu. 

2 Name the Character: The following Character Screen lists 
the attributes of the adventure character selected for you. 
Name your character and type in his (or her!) name. (A 
name can be up to 12 characters long.) Press RETURN. 

3 Purchase Weapons and Armor: After you've named the 
character, the next Innkeeper Screen summarizes your 
character and lists his Weapons, Armor and amount of 
Silver. A menu of choices are listed at the bottom of the 
screen. Select any one, and a new Innkeeper "Purchase" 
screen will greet you and ask you for what you're willing to 
offer. 

4 Haggling: The retail prices for the Innkeeper's 
"adventureware" are listed at the bottom of the Purchase 
screen. If you're in a hurry, you can go ahead and pay 
"retail" and enter the dungeons broke — the Innkeeper will 
take you for all you're worth! Or you can Haggle with the 
Innkeeper and save yourself a few silver pieces for when 
you're in dire need of a broad sword to clean out a nasty 
little section of the dungeon. 

5 Enter the Dungeons: First select G> ENTER THE 
DUNGEON from the Main Innkeeper screen. Next select 
from "Dungeon Screen" any one of the three Temple of 
Apshai Trilogy adventure realms: The Temple of Apshai, 
The Upper Reaches of Apshai or the dreaded Curse of 
Ra. Once you choose the realm, you then select one of the 
realm's four Levels to Enter. Level One is the easiest and 
of course Level Four will be the most challenging. If you 
make a mistake or change your mind press [0] for the next 
selection choice and you can "Exit" to Main Innkeeper 
screen. 

Go ahead . . . Enter the dungeons . . . you may be just in 
time for lunch . . .

Thirteen Steps to 
Staying Healthy 



1. Building a Character: It's easiest at first to let the Innkeeper choose a character 
for you — one who will embody a balance of Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, 
Intelligence, Intuition and Ego. 

2. Buying Weapons and Armor: Don't arm yourself to the hilt. Remember, you 
have to carry your Weapons and Armor. A heavy sword cuts down on your 
mobility — a Great Sword requires two hands, which means you can't carry a 
shield. You'll soon grow tired, weary and despite your impressive appearance 
down at the "Ye Olde Dragon Tavern," in the heat of battle, you'll perform like 
a giant tortoise on its back! 

3. Entering the Temple: Try out Level One of a new realm. The three Trilogy 
realms all offer different strange and terrifying challenges, so it's smart to take it 
easy at first. Learn the first few rooms thoroughly, checking for hidden traps, 
doorways and the monsters that join you for fun and games. Note the intensity 
of their attacks, how badly you were wounded and how much strength you 
retained after an attack. 

4. To Move: Point your character in the direction you want to go by pressing letter 
keys (If you have a joystick or mouse, refer to the Apshai Command Card): 

[L] Left, [R] Right, [V] Volte^face (turn around 180°) 

Press number keys 0 through 9 to Move that many steps. The character will 
Move the number of steps you entered after you press the number. 

5. To Fight: Fighting Commands are represented by letter keys on your keyboard. 
To mix it up with a monster you press the appropriate letter key: [A] (Attack) is 
a simple stroke with your sword, while [T] (Thrust) is a complete attack more 
likely to wound your enemy, but also more likely to end in your being hurt. 

6. Wounds and Fatigue: Despite your best efforts, you will suffer Wounds. Salves 
(bought from the Innkeeper) and Elixirs (found in the dungeons) can heal you. 
Fighting and moving cause Fatigue, which is a rating of your energy. You can 
simply stop moving in order to rest and regain your energy. If Fatigue reads 100% 
you are in great shape. If it's below zero (0), you are too tired to defend yourself. 
Similarly, if Wounds are 100% then you're perfectly fit. Keep an eye on your 
character's Fatigue and Wounds rating — it's the key information you need to 
make snap decisions on whether to stand and fight or cut and run! 



8 



7. Levels: Each of the three Temple Trilogy realms has four Levels for a total of 
twelve Levels. Level One will always be the easiest. Monsters grow progressively 
fiercer and more intense in Levels Two thru Four. But the treasures and rewards 
are richer. 

8. Chance and Probability: How fast you — the mortal — press the Command letter 
keys or the red fire button on the joystick will not help your character in a sword 
melee with a giant Apshai ant. The outcome will be determined by your 
character's Wounds and Fatigue, Strength and Weapons, whether he stands close 
enough to the enemy to strike them, and so forth. 

9. Monsters: They either haunt and terrorize a single room, or wander the passages 
and rooms of Apshai in search of prey. Thus by fleeing a room you can only 
escape the "single room" Monsters. 

10. Commands: Keep the Apshai Command Card in front of you. It has most of the 
basic Commands and instructions you'll need for your adventure into the 
dungeons of Apshai. There are Commands that locate and open Secret Doors, 
discover hidden Traps, administer healing Elixirs and allow you to speak with 
monsters. 

11. Experience: The longer your character survives the grueling adventure into the 
dungeons of Apshai, the more Experience he (or she) gains. As long as you don't 
turn your computer off, this "experience" remains with your character as you 
proceed through the various Levels of the three Apshai realms. Even if you are 
slain and rescued by Lowenthal the Wizard, your character will retain his 
existing Experience rating. The higher your Experience, the better your chances 
are of meeting the evermore terrifying challenges of the Temple dungeons (See 
"Experience" on page 19). 

12. Treasures: A glittering collection of Treasures are hidden within the dungeons of 
Apshai. Use the "Get" command to pick them up. Once out of the dungeon, 
the Innkeeper will be more than pleased to help you evaluate your Treasure. 

13. Magic: You'll discover wonderful and exotic forms of Magic in special healing 
potions, and in weapons of unusual power and in odd herbs and flowers. 



The 



Rules 




Characters and Equipment 



As in other role-playing games, in the Temple of Apshai Tribgy, the incredibly com- 
plex factors that make up the simplest human being have been abstracted into a few 
basic characteristics, related numerically from a low of 3, to an average of 10 or 11, 
and up to a high of 18. The higher the number, the greater/higher/stronger is the at- 
tribute. A 90-lb. weakling might have a Strength of 6 or less, while the average pro 
football player would have a Strength of 14 or more. In published "Dungeons and 
Dragons" games these numbers are typically obtained by rolling three dice; in this 
case, however, the computer generates them randomly. 

There are Six Basic Attributes — three physical and three mental — used in The Temple 
of Apshai Tribgy to give a distinctive character to each dungeon adventurer: 

Strength determines how physically strong your character is: how much weight 
(treasure and equipment) he can carry, for instance. The Strength attribute also con- 
trols how heavy a weapon he can use and how much damage one of his blows will do 
to whomever (or whatever) he's fighting. • 

Constitution is a measure of health and endurance — general physical fitness. The 
higher the Constitution, the farther a character can run before collapsing, and the 
more wounds he can sustain before dying. Since the ability to move or fight without 
becoming exhausted is also responsible for keeping an adventurer alive, this is perhaps 
the single most important attribute. 

Dexterity is a matter of reflexes, coordination and even eyesight. Someone with high 
Dexterity has an edge in weapons use; he's more likely to hit what he's aiming at and 
is better at keeping his shield between an attacking weapon, claw, or mandible and 
his mortal self. Someone with a really low Dexterity might be so clumsy he would 
have trouble hitting the proverbial barn door. 

Intelligence is reasonably self-explanatory, although in DUNJONQUEST it is limited 
to what might be termed left-brain intelligence: the ability to reason logically and to 
express oneself verbally. In many systems (including the one on which DUNJON- 
QUEST is based), Intelligence is connected with the ability to work magic. In The 
Temple of Apshai Trilogy the major function of Intelligence is to affect a character's 
ability to bargain with the Innkeeper or to parley with monsters. 



10 



Intuition, the complement of Intelligence, is a measure of right-brain functions (real 
and hypothetical): spatial perception, getting an answer from "inadequate" data, an 
awareness of the spiritual or mystical aspects of the universe, ESP, and plain, pure 
luck. Someone with a high Intuition attribute is more likely to detect Secret Doors, 
Traps, and unpleasant surprises. A character with an exceptionably low Intuition 
might be doing well to find an open doorway without a signpost. 

Ego measures mental toughness and willpower. A character with a strong Ego can 
more easily influence others (the Innkeeper or monsters) and is more likely to fight 
fiercely despite his wounds ("When the going gets tough, the tough get going," as the 
saying goes). Someone with a weak Ego will not do as well when the tide of battle 
turns against him. 

All three physical attributes may influence your choice of Equipment, which, in the 
Temple Trilogy includes five kinds of bladed weapons (swords), a bow and arrows, five 
types of armor, and two different sizes of shields. Generally, the bigger, heavier, and 
more expensive an item, the more effective it is, although heavier Equipment is more 
tiring to wear, use and carry. A larger sword is naturally capable of doing more 
damage than a smaller one (though not every time), but it takes more strength to use. 
A character with low Strength is restricted to the lighter weapons. The most powerful 
weapon, a Great Sword, requires two hands and, consequently, cannot be used with a 
shield. 

Because it is not Fatiguing and is, at least until a monster gets within chomping 
range, the safest form of combat, firing arrows at a beastie from a distance is often 
desirable. However, arrows will only hit if the monster is on a straight line vertically 
or horizontally away from you, and a good sword blow may do more damage. Trying 
to play Robin Hood while an unpleasant critter is chewing or clawing on your arm is 
also dangerous, but distance-shooting certainly saves wear and tear on the armor (and 
body). 

If you are hit, bit or struck, the armor you are wearing will protect you from some 
damage. The attack has to penetrate a layer of leather or steel to get at the stuff that 
counts — your tender flesh. Plate Armor naturally provides much more protection than 
leather. Shields make it harder for you to be hit, although a particularly good chomp 
may glance off the shield, the armored sleeve, and your character's body. A large 
shield is, obviously, a bigger barrier to such incursions than a smaller one, but in the 
hands of a character with high Dexterity a small shield may be nearly as effective. 

Characters From Past Adventures 

If you have played other Adventure Games — either on computers or with published 
"Dungeons and Dragons" games — and wish to bring one of your favorite characters 
from another game into The Temple of Apshai Trilogy, you are welcome to do so; in- 
stead of having the Innkeeper create a new character for you, enter the attributes of 
your old one. (Note, however, that these must be within DUN JON QUEST'S 
"human" range of 3-18). Depending on the game system you are used to using, you 
can substitute Intuition for Wisdom, Luck, Power, and Charisma for Ego,; while these 
are not exact correspondences, this is the easiest method of "translation." 

If you are bringing in "high-level" characters, you should be aware of certain im- 
portant differences between DUNJONQUEST and other systems. Neither attributes 
nor "hit points" are raised wholesale with increases in experience. A lOth-level fighter 
is formidable but not a Sherman tank. Also, the limits of a microcomputer-based sys- 
tem do not yet permit the use of all the different sorts of magic items you may have 
picked up in published "Dungeons and Dragons" games. 



11 



If you wish to buy things from the Innkeeper, you should note that The Temple of Ap- 
shai Tribgy is on the silver standard. If you are used to playing on a gold standard, 
please alter your gold pieces to silver and your silver to copper. (You may reverse the 
process if you wish to take your Temple Tribgy treasure back into your usual adventure 
game world). 

The first two Levels of each of the three Temple Trilogy realms are appropriate for 1st 
to 3rd level "Dungeons and Dragons" characters, while the lower Levels are more 
suited to 4th to 6th level characters. 

We invite you to project yourself into the labyrinth. See and touch the treasures, hear 
and smell the creatures that inhabit the place. Discover for yourself the fantasy world 
of Apshai! 

The Innkeeper 

Since the rules of the Temple of Apshai Trilogy game are actually programmed into the 
computer's memory, there is very little you need to know to play the game. There are, 
however, a few basics you should be familiar with to make the best decisions during 
your adventure. The following material describes the use of the Innkeeper and Dunjon- 
Master segments of the game system, the Commands for Controlling your Character, 
Gaining Experience, Evaluating Treasure, and Resurrecting a Character who dies. 

Generating A Character 

When the Temple of Apshai Trilogy begins, the wily Innkeeper greets you with a few 
suggestions: 



The Innkeeper Screen 




A> Restore a Game in Progress: If you have saved a game on a disk, then this se- 
lection restores that game. 

B> Load a Character From Disk: If you have saved a character on a disk, this selec- 
tion loads your character and escorts him to the Inn. 

C> Create a New Character at Random: This selection asks the Innkeeper to create 
a character (your playing piece). The Innkeeper will generate a character randomly 
and display his (or her) attributes on the screen. 



12 



D> Enter Thine Own Character: This selection allows you to enter your own char- 
acter (perhaps one you have used in some other adventure game). The DunjonMaster 
(computer program) will prompt you for each one of your vital statistics and posses- 
sions. 

Once you have decided on a name for yourself, all of the above information should be 
written down so that you can re-use it at a later date. 

The Innkeeper creates a character — your playing piece for the game. This simply in- 
volves answering a series of questions put to you by the Innkeeper. For your first game 
you'll probably want the Innkeeper to create your characters, so you will select C> 
from the main Innkeeper screen. In later forays into the dungeon you may want to 
enter in characters created in other fantasy role-playing games, or you may want to 
reuse a previously generated character (see Experience). You may take the same char- 
acter into the dungeon as often as you like, until the character dies (see "On Death 
And Dying"). If you have asked the Innkeeper to create a character for you, he will 
create the following on your Character Screen: 



The Innkeeper has helped you create the heroic character who will challenge the an- 
cient mysteries and horrors of the fabled Temple of Apshai Trilogy. The chosen one 
must then be outfitted with purchases of armor and weapons befitting his ilk, tempera- 
ment and courage — and budget. The full Innkeeper screen now appears:

he could be a major force 
amongst adventurers. 



A young pup adventurer: 

"Huptu" before a trip to the 
Innkeeper. With his pauper's 



budget, he will be lucky to 
leave with a decent sword 
and an arrow or two. The 
Innkeeper gives him about 
two minutes before being 
"slain" and resurrected by a 
"cleric." But he'll gain 



valuable experience. He's 
got plenty of brains, a 



healthy ego and no common 
sense — but if he keeps trying 




13 



Purchasing Equipment 

The Innkeeper will query you for Purchases of Swords, Shields, Armor, a Bow, Ar- 
rows, and healing Salves. For each of the first three categories, several items are listed 
in the order of their effectiveness, with the first item being the least effective. For ex- 
ample, under Armor the Innkeeper displays the following list: 



Purchase Screen 




Leather Armor is the least effective type and Full Plate is the best. It is also true that 
the more effective types of Weapons and Armor weigh more, and so are more tiring 
to carry and use (see Fatigue). 

Haggling 

Appearing next to each item for sale is an "offered price." But you have to Haggle 
with the wily Innkeeper for a fair price by entering a number less than the suggested 
price. You can, however, only purchase those items listed. Any other items, such as 
magic weapons, magic armor, and alas, more money, have to be found in the 
dungeon. 



The Temple Awaits 

The time has come to enter one of the three realms of The Temple of Apshai Trilogy. 
Word has spread amongst the denizens of the dungeon: "A new adventurer has left 
our friend the Innkeeper. . ."To begin your adventure select G> ENTER THE 
TEMPLE, then Realm, and last, a Level from the Innkeeper menus. "He may be just 
in time for lunch ..." 




The DunjonMaster 

Entering and Exiting the Dungeon 

When you first Enter a realm Level, you will be just inside the door of the first room 
on that Level. You will always Enter a Level of the dungeon at the same place. From 
that point on, you are free to roam about on the Level as you please. To leave the 
dungeon or to move to a different Level, you must first Exit the dungeon, then re- 
enter at the entrance to the next Level. The four Levels for each of three Trilogy 
realms are described in detail in The Apshai Scrolls Master Reference Guide beginning 
on page 22 . 

The Apshai Adventure Screen 

The Apshai Adventure Screen is divided into two windows: The Map Window and the 
DunjonMaster Window. As you move through the Trilogy realms, The DunjonMaster 
renders a graphic map of the passageways and rooms of the dungeons on the Map 
Window. Your character's status, including the number of the room you are currently 
in, your physical condition, and how much weight you are currently carrying are 
displayed on the DunjonMaster Window. The DunjonMaster reports blow-by-blow 
accounts of battles with monsters in the bottom part of the DunjonMaster Window. 
Messages are also posted in this section. There are a number of possible messages, and 
more than one of these may appear at the same time. The circled numbers in the 
illustration correspond to the descriptions under the sample display. 



The Apshai 
Adventure Screen 




1 — The number of the Room you are in. Passages are also given Room Numbers. 

2 — Shows your level of Wounds — see On Death And Dying. 

3 — Shows your Fatigue level — see Fatigue. 

4 — Shows how much Weight you are carrying. 

5 — Shows how many healing Salves you have. 

6 — Shows how many healing Elixirs you have. 

7 — Shows the number of Arrows you are carrying. 

8 — Shows the number of Magic Arrows you are carrying. 

9 — Tells you what Monster you are fighting. 

10 — Relays Messages and Battle Reports. 

11 — Describes the last Treasure you found plus other important Messages.

Apshai Commands 

There are a number of keyboard Commands available to you for maneuvering your 
character through the Trilogy dungeons. These Commands are discussed below under 
three major headings: Movement, Battle, and Special Commands. The Apshai Command 
Card included in your game package summarizes them and their meanings. Make sure 
that the Apshai Command Card you have is applicable to your computer system. 

Movement 

Check "Movement" on your Apshai Command Card. Movement lists all the movement 
commands used for your computer type. For some computer versions, you must face 
the direction in which you want to move by turning left, right, or completely around 
(volte-face); then, you actually move when you enter the speed (0 to 9 feet per 
"turn"). For other versions, such as the IBM PC, you simply move up, down, right, 
or left by pressing the cursor arrow keys on the numerical keypad. 

It is important to remember that the faster you move — the more steps per turn — the 
more tired you become (see Fatigue). Since monsters cannot follow you out of a room, 
you only need to "run" for short intervals. (Of course, if there is a monster in the 
next room . . . ) 

Movement: First, turn your character in the direction you want to go: (1) Right, Left 
or Volte-face (turn around 180°); (2) You select the "speed" from 0 to 9 feet per 
"turn." If you select "1" the character will take one step in the direction pointed. 
Select "9" and the character will "leap" nine steps in that direction. 

Joystick and Mouse Control: If you have a joystick or mouse connected to your system 
you can move the character using these control devices. The Apshai Command Card 
provides specific joystick or mouse instructions designed for your computer system. But 
keep in mind, a joystick or mouse doesn't offer any "realtime" advantage in terms of 
speed and reflexes as in arcade-style video games — just convenience. The omniscient 
DunjonMaster reserves the right to judge the speed, power and outcome of your at- 
tacks. 

Battle Commands 

There are several Battle Commands to choose from when doing battle with monsters: 
Attack, Thrust, Parry, Bow and Arrows and Magic Arrows. Battle Commands are 
represented by letter keys on your keyboard and for your quick reference are listed on 
your Apshai Command Card. 

Attack is a single swing of the sword, but you must be within striking distance of your 
foe or the DunjonMaster will display the message: "TOO FAR TO HIT." 

Thrust is an all out attack meant to inflict mortal wounds upon monsters — but also 
more likely to end in your being hurt. Although a Thrust increases your chances to 
strike and damage monsters, it also makes it easier for the monster to return the favor. 
A Thrust also requires more energy which means your Fatigue rating drops substan- 
tially. 

Parry helps shield you against a monster's attack while you conserve your energy 
(Fatigue). But if you Parry, you'll find it more difficult to hit the monster. Parrying 
also allows you to rest and regain your energy without letting your guard down. 

Bow and Arrow: When attacking with a Bow and Arrow, you must be facing the 
monster (and the further away you are the better, since the monster cannot hurt you 



16 



unless it is within the melee distance). If you try to fire an Arrow while the monster 
is within striking range of you, it becomes much easier for the monster to get a taste 
of you since you won't be able to fend off his attack — the DunjonMaster correctly 
assumes you are now hitting the monster over the head with a wooden Bow. 

Magic Arrows also are good long range weapons, however a Magic Arrow is more 
likely to hit its target and it does more damage than a standard arrow. Magic arrows 
can only be found in the dungeons, since no one who has them is likely to sell them. 
Firing either type of Arrow generally allows you to regain spent Fatigue. 

Special Commands 

The Special Commands vary from healing yourself to attempting to talk to a monster. 
Each Special Command is listed on your Apshai Command Card and described in the 
following paragraphs. 

Opening Doors: Nearly every room has at least one Door (also see Secret Doors 
below), which must be Opened before you can go through it. To Open a Door, go up 
to within one foot of it. While facing it, (be sure you are aligned correctly) give the 
"Open Door" command. The Door will then Open, and you may walk through it to 
the next room. 

Once a Door has been opened, it will stay Opened until you go to a different Level or 
reinitialize the game. The Door also remains Open when you save the game. 

Secret Doors: Secret Doors are hidden from view and must be located before they can 
be opened. To locate a Secret Door, use the "Examine Wall for Secret Door" command 
listed on the Apshai Command Card. You must be facing the wall you are examining, 
but you don't have to be next to it. The DunjonMaster will respond with: 
"NOTHING" or "A SECRET DOOR! . " 

Do not be fooled by a "NOTHING" response; sometimes Secret Doors are only lo- 
cated after the wall has been examined several times. When the Secret Door is found, 
open it the same way you would an ordinary door. 

Traps: A Trap may come in any one of a number of forms, ranging from darts that 
spring out from a treasure chest to a pit in the floor of the room. They can be located 
anywhere in a room, but a room does not have to have a Trap. You can search for a 
Trap by following the Trap instructions on the Asphai Command Card. As with Secret 
Doors, it is possible to miss a Trap, but again, you can search all you want. When 
you search for and find a Trap, its location becomes obvious, and you can usually 
avoid it by going around it. 

Finding Treasure: All Treasures in the Trilogy realms are described in the Treasures 
section by Level, in The Apshai Scrolls. To find out what kind of Treasure is in a par- 
ticular room, you must first move to within one foot and grab it, using the appropriate 
command. (Before doing so, it may be wise to search for Traps.) The DunjonMaster 
then displays the number of that Treasure which can be referenced to The Apshai 
Scrolls section. The DunjonMaster keeps track of all your Treasures for you and lists 
each at the end of your adventure, back at the Inn (refer to Evaluating Treasure). 

Note: If you find a sword in the dungeon, you must leave behind your old sword 
before you can use the new one. Swords are jealous of their possessor's attentions! You 
always have the option of ignoring the new sword and keeping your old one. 

Dropping Treasure: If you should decide after picking up a Treasure that you don't 
want it, you can put it down again at any time using the "Drop Treasure" command 
and then entering the number of the Treasure you want to Drop (refer to the Apshai 
Command Card). 

17 



Hearken or Query: All characters visiting the Temple of Apshai Trilogy have special 
Listening Powers. By using the appropriate command on the Apshai Command Card, 
you can sense the presence of another creature in the next room, even on the other 
side of a wall or closed door. This command only works if you are facing the wall or 
door you want to listen at. It is similar to the find Traps and Secret Door commands in 
that there is a percentage chance you will not hear anything, even if there really is a 
monster lurking in wait for you. When this command is used, the DunjonMaster tells 
you that you found "NOTHING" or you are given the name of the lurking creature. 

Speaking with Monsters: Speaking with Monsters is another ability you have as a 
traveler in the dungeon. The command gives you a chance to avoid fighting with a 
monster. If the monster is in a good mood when you speak to it, it will tell you to 
pass by and leave any treasure it is guarding untouched. However, if you then attack 
it or disturb the treasure, the monster will pursue you. But beware! Some monsters 
hate all adventurers! 

Healing: There are two items you may use to Heal your wounds: Salves and Elixirs. 
Either of these may be taken at any time, including during combat. However, the 
monster would then get a free swing. You can rest while you are healing yourself. 

Salves: Each Salve purchased from the Innkeeper will heal some of the wounds you 
have taken. This percentage varies depending on your character. The DunjonMaster 
keeps track of how many Salves you have, and upon applying one, automatically ad- 
justs the count remaining. You can see the change of the number next to the Wounds 
heading on the DunjonMaster's screen. If you attempt to use more Salves than you 
have available, the DunjonMaster will display the message: "NONE LEFT." 

Elixirs (Ylixirs): These exotic liquid refreshments work the same way as Salves, ex- 
cept they are more powerful and heal a larger percentage of your wounds. Elixirs must 
be found as Treasure and cannot be purchased from the Innkeeper. To execute the 
command, press the appropriate key identified on your Apshai Command Card. 

Fatigue 

Your Fatigue rating simply determines how much energy you have at any given time. 
Exceptional exertion results in spent Fatigue, but what constitutes exceptional exer- 
tion and how much Fatigue you Expend depends on your character. Walking normally 
and firing arrows generally allow you to regain Fatigue. Activities such as running, 
fighting, and carrying heavy loads all take more energy. The amount of energy you 
Expend for any activity is also affected by your wounds. The more you are wounded, 
the more it costs you in Fatigue to perform an activity. 

If you use up more Fatigue than you have (if a negative number is displayed for 
Fatigue), you fall on the floor and pant. You will not be allowed to attack or move 
until you have recovered (that is, until a positive number is displayed). 

The DunjonMaster keeps track of and displays for you the amount of energy you have 
left. Therefore, if the display reads: "FATIGUE: 100%," all of your energy is available. 

Regaining Spent Fatigue 

While you cannot accumulate more energy than you started with, you can Regain pre- 
viously spent energy in a variety of ways. The fastest way is to stop your movement 
altogether (although this may be dangerous). You can also Regain it while firing an 
arrow or simply walking more slowly. Executing special commands also allows you to 
gain back Fatigue. Each time you rest, however, you have a chance of meeting a 
wandering monster (see Monsters). 

18 



Evaluating Treasure 

Once you are safely back at the Inn, the Innkeeper lists all of the Treasure you found 
during the adventure and adds the value of your treasures to your silver. If you intend 
to keep your character for use in future sessions, save him to disk, or make a note of 
the total so that you can re-enter it at a later time. 

Experience 

Each time that you successfully venture into the dungeon you acquire Experience 
points, which means you become a better and more powerful adventurer. This number 
is determined for you by the DunjonMaster and is based on what you accomplish 
while in the dungeon. Essentially, as you gain Experience, you become able to handle 
more difficult situations — you will notice improvements in your character. These im- 
provements come in "jumps" and may not be immediately obvious. One improvement 
is that it becomes easier for you to hit a monster and more difficult for the monster to 
hit you. 

Once The Temple of Apshai Tribgy program is loaded, it keeps track of your Experi- 
ence points on a cumulative basis. That is, if you return to the Inn to purchase more 
supplies, the DunjonMaster remembers how many Experience points you earned on 
that adventure and adds it them the Experience you gain for the next adventure. 

Saving Characters and Games 

The DunjonMaster keeps track of your character's Experience, Fatigue, Treasure, 
Weapons and Strength and will continue to perform this task until you leave the dun- 
geons and Save your character, quit the game and generate a new character or simply 
turn off the computer. If you Saved the character to a disk, all the character's key at- 
tributes at the time they're saved — the Innkeeper's Character Summary screen — will 
be remembered by the DunjonMaster when the character is loaded for a new ad- 
venture. 

The Temple of Apshai Tribgy program system has been designed to save one game and 
up to fifty adventure characters on the program disk. The Apshai Command Card or 
Apshai Guide (for IBM PC and Macintosh) provides more specific Save instructions 
and information for the computer system you own. 

Save a Game: You can save a Temple Tribgy game by entering the "Save Game" 
Command at any point or time in the game. You don't have to return to a menu 
screen — the Save Game Command for your computer system is listed on your Apshai 
Command Card and is entered directly into the keyboard. 

Save a Character: To Save a character, you can either enter the "Save Character" 
Command directly into the keyboard at any point or place in the game, or you can 
select the "Save Thy Character to Disk" menu choice from the main Innkeeper screen. 
The exact instructions for your computer system are listed on your Apshai Command 
Card. 



The Body and Soul 

On Death and Dying 

Any time a monster attacks you, there is a chance (depending on the type of armor 
you are wearing) that it will penetrate your armor and Wound you. The DunjonMaster 
keeps track of and displays how much damage you have taken on a percentage basis. 
The number displayed next to Wounds is always the percentage that you have left. 
For example, if the display reads: "WOUNDS: 90%, " you are still relatively healthy 
because only 10% of you has been wounded. 

You may Heal yourself at any time with either a Salve or an Elixir (see Healing). You 
can continue to function normally until you reach 0% or less (except that your Fatigue 
expenditure increases). At that point you are dead. However, there is a chance you 
can be "raised from the dead." The following paragraphs explain this phenomenon in 
more detail. 

Getting Yourself Resurrected 

If after all that hard work you should find yourself slain, don't panic. All may not yet 
be lost. After all, you are not the only adventurer in the dungeon and some kind 
soul, having stumbled across your body lying on the floor, may drag you out to safety 
and see to it that you are Resurrected. Of course, having gone to all the trouble, he 
will most likely want something in return as a thank you. 

If you should die, you — and all your possessions — may simply be eaten by a wandering 
monster. (Fresh adventurer is considered to be a delicacy by the monsters inhabiting 
the dungeon). This is the worst case. You may also be found by one of three charac- 
ters: a dwarf, a wizard, or a cleric, all of whom will ask for some type of payment. The 
DunjonMaster tells you immediately which of the four cases has occurred. 



20 



Dungeon Dwellers 



Friends of the Dungeon 

The Dwarf: The second worst case is to be found by Olias the Dwarf. While he will 
not eat you, he will take all your money, including any gems and jewels, and any 
magical items you might have. This includes magic swords, armor, and arrows. You 
will be alive but you will be very poor. 

The Magic-User: Lowenthal the Wizard is only slightly easier to please than Olias. In 
return for your life, he will take any special magical items you might have, leaving 
you with your cash, gems, jewels, weapons, and armor. 

The Cleric: The fortunate ones will be found by Bendic the wandering priest. This 
kind soul (if he can find his way out of the dungeon), will resurrect you and simply 
ask that you make a donation to his sect after you get back to the Inn. 

Monsters 

Although a complete description of the types of Monsters in the dungeon is contained 
in the Apshai Scrolls "Monsters of Apshai' section, it is helpful to know that Monsters 
can be either Fixed or Wandering. With a Fixed Monster, each time you go in a Level 
of a realm, that monster (and all other items) reappears exactly where it was previ- 
ously. These monsters are normally there to guard a particular treasure. A Wandering 
Monster is generated randomly by the DunjonMaster and may appear anywhere at any 
time on the appropriate Level. 

You do not have to fear running into the most powerful monsters on the first Level of 
any of the three Trilogy realms. Some discretion is used in generating them and only 
first Level monsters are generated for the first Level of a Trilogy realm. Don't be 
surprised though, if you find what first appears to be the same monster on more than 
one Level, and then discover it to be tougher than you remembered — it too has 
gained some "experience." 

Neither Fixed nor Wandering Monsters ever follow you out of a room, but they will 
be waiting for you when you go back into that room. Tempk of Apshai Tribgy 
Monsters are extremely patient. . .

The Apshai 
Scrolls 



A Master Reference Guide 

The following guide is arranged by game: first The Temple of Apshai, then 
The Upper Reaches of Apshai, and last The Curse of Ra. Each game is further 
broken down by Level. Detail on Rooms, Traps and Treasures is presented by 
Level as well. 



Temple of Apshai 23 

This underground Temple is the last remembrance of the once mighty race of 
Apshai. Steel your sword well for the dangers that lie ahead. This may be a land 
of gems beyond compare, but it's also filled with monsters fierce and foul. 

Upper Reaches of Apshai <> 50 

The small town sitting above the ruins of Apshai is now open to adventurers 
for exploration. The Innkeeper's Backyard, Merlis' Cottage, Olios' Cellar, and 
Benedic's Monastery offer everything from the dead refusing to stay in their 
graves to peculiar happenings in the vegetable garden. 

There's clearing, painting and repairing to be done in the houses and yards 
above Apshai. Perhaps not quite what you imagined when you started out, but 
there's aplenty! 150 Rooms await. 



Curse of Ra ♦ 62 

Welcome to the fabled land of Ra, home of the Sphinx, the Pyramid, the 
Altar of Ra, and through it all the Curse. This is the last of the Apshai 
journey, wherein you will learn the secret of the Curse, and perhaps learn your 
own fate. 



22 



Temple of Apshai 

Monsters 



Antmen— These creatures look like six foot long ants walking upright on their 
hindmost legs with the other four legs free for manipulation. There are significant 
differences between the classes of antmen but unfortunately these differences are 
only discernible to other antmen. They attack with their mandibles and sometimes 
with their forelegs as well. 

Carrion Beasts— These creatures resemble squids equipped with spindly legs. 
They generally have six tentacles with which they maul and crush their prey. Their 
bodies are covered with a thin but hard carapace and they are able to travel along 
walls and ceilings. 

Centipedes— This represents a nest of the little buggers such as might take up 
residence under a chest or in some remote crevice. Their bites are mildly 
poisonous. 

Ghouls— are misshapen creatures with longer than normal arms, wicked claws, 
and a mouthful of razor sharp fangs which they ably employ to crack the bones of 
their prey. They have tough hide and stand about seven feet tall. They are said to 
eat the soul of their prey as it exits the dying body. 

Giant Amoeba— This creature is a mass of gray protoplasm which has a strong 
solvent effect on living flesh. They range from six to ten feet in diameter. 

Giant Ants— These huge insects are four to six feet long and travel quickly on 
their six legs. They attack their prey with their large mandibles. They are entirely 
encased in a hard shell. 

Giant Bombadier Beetles— are about three feet in diameter and fly around on a 
pair of glossy wings. They can generate a good speed on their little wings and attack 
their prey in bowling rushes. 

Giant Fire Beetles— These melon sized creatures are copper red beetles which 
are capable of generating tremendous heat within their bodies with which they 
attack their prey. They have a thin shell but move about very quickly on the wing. 

Giant Leeches— A disgusting rubbery grey, these are two or three feet long. They 
travel about on a trail of slime and drain their prey of body fluids with their sucker 
mouths. 

Giant Mosquitos— have a three or four foot wingspan and maneuver their 
slender bodies about rapidly through the air. They insert their proboscises into their 
prey and drain the body fluids. 

Giant Rats— are four feet tall at the shoulder and have nasty teeth. They are dirty 
creatures and are recognizable by their musky smell. 



23 



Giant Spiders — look like a tarantula-black widow hybrid with a hairy black body 
and black and red banded legs. They are reputed to be quite poisonous as one might 
expect from the four or five foot size. 

Giant Termites — are two to three feet long and move about on flimsy wings. They 
have soft shells and are brown in color. 

Giant Ticks— are foot long ticks and are dark brown or black in color. They are 
hard shelled and leap about on their strong hindmost legs. They drain body fluids 
with their proboscises. 

Giant Wasps— are three or four feet in length and their thorax is tipped by a 
paralyzing stinger. They are very mobile and will attempt to sting their prey into 
submission before burying their prize for future consumption. 

Jellies — are formless masses of translucent jelly about three feet high and six or 
eight feet across; their touch dissolves flesh. They have no socially redeeming value. 

Skeletal Bats — These feral creatures are bare skeletons of bats with red ember- 
like eyes. They have wingspans of two or three feet and will attempt to bite their 
prey with their sharp fangs. 

Skeletons — are the animated skeletons of men which now stalk the underground 
passages in search of victims. They are said to devour the soul of their victim as it 
exits the dying body. 

Spiders— This represents a whole nest of small spiders. These little killers are coal 
black and have white eyes. They inhabit small dark spaces such as the insides 
of chests. 

Swamp Rats — are two to three feet long and are famed for their ravenous 
appetites. They will fearlessly attack anything that moves or has a strong smell and 
they eat anything they can swallow. They come in your choice of decorator colors. 

Vampire Bats — These creatures inhabit the darker recesses of the dungeon. 
They are generally black and have wingspans around three feet. They bite their 
victims with their razor sharp fangs and drink the blood which flows from the 
wound. 

Wraiths— These ghostly creatures appear as skeletal figures garbed in hooded 
frocks. Their eyes are fiery points of light within their cowls. They move effortlessly 
about leaving no trace of their passing and are capable of passing through solid 
matter at will. Many have died under the chill touch of their bony hands. 

Zombies — These creatures are animated corpses which stalk the dark passages in 
search of prey. They sometimes utilize weapons garnered from their prior victims. 
They too are said to devour the souls of their victims as these exit the dying bodies. 



24 



Level 1 
Rooms, Traps, Treasures 

Level 1 — Rooms 

Room One— The smooth stonework of the passageway floor shows that advanced 
methods were used in its creation. A skeleton sprawls on the floor just inside the 
door, a bony hand, still clutching a rusty dagger, outstretched toward the door to 
safety. A faint roaring sound can be heard from the far end of the passage. 

Room Two— A stream runs through this natural stone chamber. A narrow landing 
adjacent to the corridor at the north end of the chamber allows easy access to 
the stream. The water flows in from a cut in the west wall and flows out under 
the north wall near the landing. In an alcove near one end of the landing there 
are many urns and pots. The water is very clear and appears to be about three 
feet deep. 

Room Three— A finely carved and painted mural fills the east wall of the passage, 
opposite the opening, depicting men tilling the soil. A ransacked backpack rests 
under the mural. A roaring sound can be heard from the north. 

Room Four— is a smoothly carved passage with a native granite ceiling. Slippery 
green moss fills every crack and crevice in the room, and the air is filled with its 
heavy scent. An empty purse lies in the southwest corner. A droning sound can 
be heard. 

Room Five — is a pond-filled room with a small landing to the south. The surface 
of the sluggish water is covered with moss and a number of black lilies rest 
peacefully upon the green matting. The water can be found to be about three feet 
deep and flows almost imperceptibly in under the west wall and out under the 
east wall. Some of the lilies can be reached from the landing. 

Room Six— Water flows into this chamber from the northern part of the west wall 
and out again through the southern part of the same wall. The surface of the water 
is covered with moss and multi-colored lilies, some within reach of the landing. 
Experiments will reveal the water to be about three feet deep. 

Room Seven— The moss-covered water in this chamber appears to be three feet 
deep, also. A rusting suit of platemail can be seen on the murky bottom. White lilies 
rest on the surface of the pool. Water flows into the chamber from under the east 
wall and out under the west wall. 

Room Eight— is a passage with smooth stone walls and floor and a native rock 
ceiling. A loud roaring sound may be heard from the north. A humanoid skull 
rests on the floor in the middle of the passageway. 

Room Nine — is of roughly hewn stone. The floor has been levelled by manmade 
means, but the walls and ceiling are native rock. Cobwebs fill every crack and 
hang from the ceiling, dancing slowly in the slight breeze. A cloying, sweet odor 
fills the air. 



25 



Room Ten— The air of the room is filled with a cloying, sweet aroma, causing 
the senses to reel. The walls of the room are covered with moss which is largely 
brown and dried with only a few pale green patches remaining. Breaking off any 
part of the green moss will reveal it as the source of the aroma. 

Room Eleven — A mist drifts into the corridor from an opening in the west wall 
and a deafening roar is heard. Moss covers the floor before the opening to the 
west and a rusty sword lies on the mossy stone. 

Room Twelve— The floor, walls, and ceiling of the chamber bear the marks of 
tools. A glow fills the opening to the east and a foul, musty odor is in the air. 

Room Thirteen— The room is well lighted by the phosphorescent glow emanating 
from the greenish-yellow algae covering the high ceilings of native rock and 
well-worked stone walls to the north and south. A broken bow lies in two pieces 
on the floor near the east wall. 

Room Fourteen— A loud roaring sound may be heard from the west end of the 
passage. A pyramid of medium-sized stones fills one corner of the north wall at 
the east end of the corridor. 

Room Fifteen — is an irregular cave of native rock. The walls and floor are covered 
with a heavy matting of multi-hued moss. The walls are brilliant reds, greens, and 
blues, while the floor is a pastel yellow. A wooden box lies topless in the middle 
of the cavern floor. Inside lies a well-made cloak. The material of the cloak seems 
to shimmer in the torchlight. 

Room Sixteen— Here you find the source of the roaring sound. A stream flows 
into the chamber from the south, across the large water wheel, and plummets 
into a pit in the floor of the cave. The bottom of the pit cannot be seen, but 
experiments will indicate that it is a very long drop. 

Room Seventeen— Only the floor has been smoothed in this chamber, the walls 
and ceiling having been left in the natural state. The air smells of decaying vegetable 
matter. A small mound of stones against the west wall in the north end of the 
passage partially blocks the way to the north. 

Room Eighteen— The passage reeks of spoiled and rotten matter. A strip of cloth 
sticks out from beneath a mound of dirt in the southern portion of the passageway. 

Room Nineteen— Small bones litter the floor of this chamber and crunch under 
the boots of the incautious traveller. 

Room Twenty— The walls of the room are covered with algae. Most of the algae 
is black and rotten, but the few remaining brown patches have a nutty aroma, and, 
if tasted, are reminiscent of spiced bread. 

Room Twenty-one — The west wall of the cavern shows the marks of carving 
tools, but the rest is natural rock. The floor of the room is overgrown with 
mushrooms of two varieties. One has broad, flat caps and is white with brown 
splotches, while the second variety has black, tightly rounded caps. 

Room Twenty-two — This cavern is also overgrown with the same types of 
mushrooms as are found in room twenty-one. A skeleton lies among the 
mushrooms still clutching the remnants of a sack. 



26 



Room Twenty-three— The native rock wails of the room are covered with algae. 
Most of the algae is black and rotten, but the remaining brown patches have a 
nutty scent and taste like spiced bread. The exoskeleton of a huge ant lies in the 
middle of the chamber. 

Room Twenty-four— is a mossy, carved stone landing. The air is very humid 
and smells of damp and mold. A slime-covered sack rests against the eastern wall 
of the landing. 

Room Twenty-five— A stagnant pond fills the south end of the carved stone 
chamber, with a narrow landing at the south end. White mold covers the surface 
of the water, save the southeast corner, where a gold-colored seaweed is in 
evidence. Tests will reveal the water to be three feet deep, but the bottom of the 
pool cannot be seen through the murk. 

Room Twenty-six— A shallow pond fills most of the room. The surface of the 
water is covered with a white mold, except in the northeast corner where a clump 
of golden-brown seaweed is visible. 

Room Twenty-seven— The floor of this tunnelled passage is streaked with slime. 
A well-wrought iron candlestick lies at the southern end of the tunnel. 

Room Twenty-eight— The tunnel floor is streaked with a stinking slime and 
littered with small and medium-sized stones. 

Room Twenty-nine— The odor of the slime coating the entire chamber floor is 
overpowering. A trickle of water runs down the eastern wall and a small pool 
has formed in a depression in the southeast corner of the room. A rigid body in 
a finely woven cloak lies in the northeast corner. 

Room Thirty— The smoothly carved northern and southern sections of the 
chamber contrast sharply with the native granite found in the middle of the room, 
suggesting that it has been widened out from a natural passage. A quiver and some 
arrows lie on the floor in the middle of the chamber next to a sword and a 
broken bow. 

Room Thirty-one — is a narrow, low tunnel of native rock. Small slides of earth 
and rock line the sides of the passage with a larger fall of stones near the eastern 
end of the tunnel. A skeletal hand protrudes from the rockfall, an inscribed bronze 
ring visible on one of the fingers. 

Room Thirty-two— is a rough, five-foot wide tunnel with packed dirt walls, 
floor, and ceiling. A shining trail of dried fluid runs the length of the tunnel and 
the air smells of vanilla. Strange clicking sounds echo faintly through the passage. 

Room Thirty-three— A shiny trail runs the length of the packed-earth tunnel 
and the odor of vanilla fills the air. The clicking grows louder. 

Room Thirty-four— A trail of shiny excretions run the length of the passage 
and the vanilla odor is stronger than before. The clicking sound is clearly audible 
from the north end of the tunnel. 

Room Thirty-five— is a rough cave, carved out of the dense earth. The vanilla 
odor clogs the nostrils and the clicking noises are still audible from within. 
A handful of gems litters the dirt floor before the western wall. 



27 



Room Thirty-six — Vanilla fills the air and the clicking sound appears to emanate 
from nearby. A fresh slide of earth against the north wall reveals the glitter of gems 
amid the fallen earth. 

Room Thirty-seven — The odor of vanilla is strong and the clicking sounds 
continue. The east wall is studded with a number of glittering gems.

Room Fifty-nine — is a narrow passage. The opening to the north has been dug 
through the earth but shows no toolmarks. A well-worn path runs from the opening 
in the west wall into the northern passage. The air smells faintly of vanilla. 

Room Sixty — is a huge vault with stonework walls and floor and a native rock 
ceiling. Rude statues and carved pillars picture men and half-men. As the figures 
become more bestial, the workmanship becomes more primitive. Ancient tools 
and artifacts lie all about the chamber. Small stone doors of cunning device line 
the east and south walls. Several of these are open, revealing three by three by 
six foot openings into the rock. A shroud hangs from one of the open cavities. 
Glyphs of unknown symbology cover the walls. The dust of the floor is thick and 
undisturbed. The air smells of musty antiquity and death. Several urns and coffers 
in the southeast corner gleam with jeweled brilliance. 

Level 3 — Traps 

CAVE IN TRAP — There are no traps per se in the Apshaian mines. One never 
knows, however, when a rock might loose itself and cause severe damage to those 
unfortunate enough to be standing below. For this reason it is highly recommended 
that all visitors wear helmets while wandering through the ancient caverns.

Level 4 
Rooms, Traps, Treasures 

Level 4 — Rooms 

Room One — is a natural passage with the floor carved level. A well trodden path 
in the dust of the floor runs the length of the corridor. The door at the end of the 
corridor is of iron-bound wood and has a small, barred window at eye level. The 
air smells faintly of vanilla. 

Room Two — has stonework walls, floor and ceiling. The dusty floor is much 
disturbed and the air smells strongly of vanilla. A wooden table and four chairs 
stand in the middle of the room. The door to the west is wooden. 

Room Three — is a passage with an even layer of dust covering the floor. A 
discarded sack rests against the west wall halfway down the corridor. 

Room Four — A table and four chairs occupy the middle of the room. The dusty 
floor shows some large animal tracks and the air smells faintly of vanilla. A rusty 
sword leans against the wall in the southeast corner. 

Room Five— A well-worn path in the dust runs the length of a corridor and the 
air smells of vanilla. The door to the west is actually a set of double oak doors. 
The hinges look well oiled and marks in the dust on the floor betray recent opening. 

Room Six— A path in the dust runs the length of the corridor. The corpse of a 
giant rat lies in the center of the corridor. The door to the west is double and 
made of thick oak. 

Room Seven — is a huge chamber with stonework on the floor, ceiling and all but 
the west wall, which is of carved rock. The room is filled with rough cots and the 
west wall is lined with a variety of chests. The floor shows signs of frequent 
disturbance and the smell of vanilla is heavy in the air. 

Room Eight — is another huge chamber. The dusty floor shows signs of frequent 
usage and the air is filled with the smell of vanilla. Rough cots line the walls and 
stand in rows in the middle of the room, each with a nondescript wooden box 
beneath it. 

Room Nine — is a large room with masonry work everywhere but for the west and 
south walls. The latter are carved from the native granite. The walls are draped with 
the tattered remains of tapestries depicting a great battle between two armies. One 
army consists of men clad in ringmail while the other includes a wild mix of men, 
ant men, and skeletons. The banners of the second army show a praying mantis- 
like figure in green on a field of jet black. Two gold plaques hang in the southwest 
corner. 



42 



Room Ten — is a small armory. Racks of rusty weapons line the west and south 
walls. The dusty floor is undisturbed and the air is foul. An untarnished sword in a 
separate rack rest below an indecipherable iron plaque in the southwest corner. 

Room Eleven — is an ornately decorated passage. A moldering skeleton in tattered 
leather armor lies against the rusty iron door at the end of the passage. There are 
no tracks in the dust of the floor. 

Room Twelve — is a passage with an even layer of dust covering the floor. The air 
smells of decay with a hint of vanilla. The skull of a mule rests against the wall out- 
side the wooden door to the north. 

Room Thirteen — is a corridor. A worn path on the dusty floor runs the length of 
the corridor and the air smells of vanilla. The door to the north is brass-bound wood. 

Room Fourteen — is a small room. A shelf on the west wall holds a small dark 
chest with a key in the lock. The south and east walls are hung with an assortment 
of rusty arms and armor. The dusty floor shows no sign of disturbance and the air 
is foul. 

Room Fifteen — A decrepit bed occupies the north wall, a desk the south wall, and 
a table the middle of the room. The corners of the room are draped in cobwebs. 
A partially eaten and unrecognizable body rests in the southwest corner of the 
room. 

Room Sixteen — is a largish room. A small desk stands against the wall to the 
south and a larger desk occupies the west wall. The dusty floor shows faint marks 
of disturbance and the air smells musty. The door to the west is of brass-bound 
wood and stands ajar. 

Room Seventeen — is a largish room. Remnants of cloth and leather hangings 
cover the walls and the air carries a strong aroma of vanilla. The dusty floor is well 
travelled. A large cabinet stands against the west wall of the room.

and battered shields and arms. The east wall bears a large plaque of beaten gold 
which appears to be an award of some kind. 

Room Nineteen — is a large room with the south wall of carved rock. The room is 
austerely furnished with wooden planks hanging from chains on the east, west, and 
south walls. The floor is covered with mouldering straw and the air reeks of decay 
and vanilla. A dead rat lies in the center of the floor. 

Room Twenty— is a small room that appears to be a natural cave except for the 
west and north walls. A large chest stands open in the southeast corner of the 
room. The west wall is covered with soot as is the western part of the ceiling. Bones 
are scattered over the dusty floor and the air carries a strange sickly sweet odor. 
From the chest comes the gleam of jewelry and gold. 

Room Twenty-one— is a wide room with a large bed occupying the west wall and 
a rack of tattered robes in the northwest corner. A desk covered with scrolls stands 
against the east wall. There are large animal tracks in the dust of the floor and the

ridor and to the doors on the north and south walls. The air smells of vanilla. The 
doors themselves are wooden and have no locks. 



43 



Room Twenty-three — A well-worn path in the dust runs the length of the corridor 
and to the door in the north wall. The latter is brass-bound oak and in good repair. 
It bears a strange inscription that glows with a green light in the gloom. The air 
smells of vanilla. 

Room Twenty-four — is a long narrow room with wooden doors at either end. The 
walls are covered with arcane heiroglyphs and tapestries bearing the same glyphs 
hang beside the doors. The room looks often-used and the air smells heavily of 
vanilla. There are many wooden cots with tattered mattresses in the room. A large 
chest occupies the northwest corner of the room. 

Room Twenty-five — is a large room with heiroglyphs inscribed in the dark slate 
walls. Stone benches occupy the western half of the room. Although much worn by 
wear, strange heiroglyphs and scenes showing intermingled insects and men can be 
seen carved in the sides and backs of the benches. Blocks of stone, hollowed out 
on top in the shape of bowls, protrude from the walls at irregular intervals. Ornate 
black metal braziers hang from the ceiling about the edges of the room. Against the 
east wall is a raised black marble altar, carved with glyphs that give off a faint, eerie 
green glow. On the altar itself is a large marble statue of a praying mantis, forelegs 
outstretched and mandibles open. The eyes of the mantis are great rubies — a fine 
treasure if you dare grab them! A human skull stares eyelessly from the steps 
leading to the altar. The doors to the north and south are of brass-bound oak, while 
the doorway to the east is covered with a worn tapestry.

of large animals and the room reeks of musk and offal. The doors to the north and 
south are wooden and have no locks. 

Room Twenty-nine— is a smallish room furnished only with rotting cushions 
strewn about the floor. Tattered tapestries hang on the east and west walls showing 
scenes of obscene and bloody sacrifice before a mantis-shaped god. A shiny object 
protrudes from beneath one of the cushions near the center of the room. 

Room Thirty —is a passage with wooden doors to the north and south. The dusty 
floor shows the tracks of large animals and the air reeks of musk. The empty 
carapace of an antman lies at the eastern end of the passage. 

Room Thirty-one— is a passage. The dusty floor shows the tracks of large 
animals and the smell of musk is in the air. Faint clicking sounds can be heard from 
the east end of the passage.

covered with a heavy layer of soot. Three large stone ovens line the north wall and 
a long grill occupies the eastern half of the south wall. The dusty floor shows the 
tracks of large animals and the air reeks of musk. 



44 



Room Thirty-three — is a small storeroom. Heaps of grain line the walls and a 
dead giant rat rests in the southeast corner. 

Room Thirty-four — is a room filled with shelves of rotting books and scrolls. A 
desk stands near the brass-bound door to the north and a glass case occupies the 
southwest corner of the room. Inside the case is a well preserved volume bound in 
leather and bearing a title in indecipherable script. The floor is covered with an even 
layer of dust and the air smells of decay. The door to the east is wooden and hangs 
ajar from its rusty hinges. 

Room Thirty-five — A bed occupies the north wall with a desk on the south 
wall and a large cabinet against the east wall. The dusty floor shows no signs of 
disturbance. 

Room Thirty-six — is a largish room with stonework walls, floor and ceiling. The 
room is furnished with ramshackle chairs, tables and cushions and the remains of 
books and scrolls litter the apartment. A large desk and chair occupy the center of

targets painted with human silhouettes. The southernmost target still has some 
arrows stuck in it. 

Room Thirty-eight — The floor of the room is covered with the remains of straw 
mats. A variety of pieces of martial equipment litter the mats along the walls. In the 
northeast corner, a bony elbow pokes through a rent in a suit of rusty chainmail. 
A gnawed thighbone lies near the door. 

Room Thirty-nine— The dusty floor shows the tracks of large animals and the 
air reeks of musk. A discarded backpack rests on the floor in the middle of the

Level 4 — Traps 

LILY TRAP— When you disturb the chest you reveal some lilies which give off a 
cloud of fine powder that causes a severe swelling in your throat.

the tip thrusts itself toward you and then retracts. 

FLAME TRAP— A jet of flame roars out from the wall above the chest as you

Magical Items 



Magic Arms 

Magic Books 

Magic Boots 
Magic Cloaks 



These items are enhanced to varying potencies the 
exact nature of which is unavailable to adventurers. 
It is known that certain powerful blades glow with 
a light of their own. Beware of cursed items. 
These items most commonly increase certain char- 
acteristics of the reader although other effects are 
not unheard of. Their effect is permanent. 
Rumor has it that these boots enable the wearer to 
run like the wind. 

These Apshaian creations are said to protect the 
wearer from physical injury. This protection is by 
no means absolute. 



48 



Skull Rings • These rings have some power in relation to the 

living dead which wander the underground pas- 
sageways. The exact nature of these powers is 
unknown but they have figured in several miracu- 
lous escapes from the foul miscreants. 

Magic Talismans • These trinkets endow the holder with wondrous 

powers of mental perception. 

White Milky Potion • This is simply a commonly known healing potion. 

With the exceptions of the arms and the magic books, all of the magic items found 
in the ruins are enchanted with spells peculiar to the Apshaians and lose their power 
permanently if they are ever taken from the complex.

Level 1 

The Innkeeper's Backyard 

Rooms, Traps, Treasures 

The innkeeper has graciously assented to your cleaning up the yard behind his 
inn. He has warned you of the possibility of a thief in the neighborhood, however, 
and dark rumors concerning peculiar happenings in the vegetable garden have 
been circulating lately. Be careful. 

Level 1 — Rooms 

Room 1— A wide roadway with a large rock in the center. The inn lies off-stage to 
the west. To the north and south are picket fences in need of a little paint. 

Rooms 2-3— A small yard choked with weeds and littered with garbage. To the 
north is a large barn, to the east an alley, and to the south the stable area. To the 
right of the barn door are stacks of rotting garbage. Just to the left of the door is a 
small bonfire in which you notice a gleam of something other than flame. 

Rooms 4-5— Once used as a stable, this part of the yard and the roofless 
enclosure now smell of soap. The weeds are patchy, and there are traces of suds 
in the grass. Inside (Room 5), wet laundry hangs on a line in the corner. 

Rooms 6-7— The main stable area. The walls of the old building are full of badly 
patched holes, and many planks are loose. The packed earth shows little sign of 
recent activity. Inside (Room 7), cobwebs clog the corners, and mice are 
scurrying about the remains of someone's lunch. 

Rooms 8-10— The barn. The place is obviously ill-kept, and straw and feathers 
are everywhere. You hear honking to the right and loud clucking to the left. 

Room 11— A narrow alleyway between the barn and the stable. It is thick with 
weeds, but a narrow path down the center is worn down from the tread of many 
feet. Ahead is a gate in a low fence— the entrance to the berry patch. 

Rooms 12-35— The innkeeper's berry patch. It must be the right time of the 
year, because every bush seems laden with luscious, ripe berries. Since the 
innkeeper has given his permission, and you're hungry, you decide to grab a 
basket and do some picking. What you don't eat you can always sell in the village 
for a few copper pieces. While wandering through the bushes, you notice some 
tomato plants beginning to supplant the berries in some spots. There is, in fact, 
an entire tomato garden next to an old tool shed on one side of the berry patch. 
The berries are spread over a low hill that begins to slope steeply near 
the back hedge. 

Rooms 36-39— A large shed. Tools and debris are scattered about. Signs of 
recent usage and a sort of rumbling sound coming from somewhere within alert 
you to the presence of someone— or something— inside. Could it be the thief? 
Or something more sinister? 



51 



Room 40— You have stumbled across an unknown or long-forgotten passage 
that seems to lead into the hill. 

Room 41— A large cavern displaying clear signs of habitation. It's dark in here, 
and you keep stumbling into things, but something on the floor glimmers faintly. 

Rooms 42-45— A vegetable garden. Aside from a few struggling carrots, there 
seems to be nothing here but tomatoes. Some of these, however, are huge- 
bigger than pumpkins. Near the gate you discover a dead chicken. Closer 
inspection shows that it is covered not with blood but with ketchup! What can 
this mean? And what else may be hidden beneath these strangely menacing vines? 

Level 1 — Traps 

FLAME— You stepped right in the bonfire! Watch where you are going! 

DUST— Try not to kick up so much dust next time. 

NEEDLE— Some of these bushes have needle-like thorns. Be careful. 

FLIES— If you insist on walking through the garbage, then you should expect to 
put up with a few flies. 

Level 1 — Treasures 

T01— All that glitters is not gold. In fact, in this case it's copper— a copper piece 
that someone carelessly dropped. 

T02— A big cluster of berries hangs in the bush in front of you. 

T03— There are small eggs in a nest here, and you risk a fowl attack to grab 

them. 

704— You find a copper ingot, 750 copper pieces, one silver arrow, 23 silver 
pieces, 14 gold pieces, two small emeralds, and a partridge in a pear tree. 

T05— Near a hoe you find some arrows which may be of use. 

T06— In a worn leather purse you find 6 copper pieces, 7 silver pieces, 3 gold 

pieces, and a small diamond. 

T07— A large pot of very tasty chicken soup. 

T08— The laundry consists of a few shirts and a pair of pants. They are wet, not 
in your size, patched, and certainly not worth taking. 
T09— A large piece of stale cheese— the main attraction for the mice. 
T10— A large rusty chain of no use to anyone. 

Til— Some crockery, mostly broken, now empty but smelling of bad ale. 
T20— A large rock of no value. 



52 



Level 2 

Merlis' Cottage 

Rooms, Traps, Treasures 

Merlis has disappeared somewhere— vanished, owing you wages for repairing 
and painting the fence around his cottage. With some trepidation, you have 
decided to venture forth into his abode in search of the lost wages. You suspect 
Merlis has done this deliberately, to tease or test you; however, you also suspect 
that if you do something serious (such as harming his cats), he may become very 
angry— and it never pays to make a magician mad. 

Prepare for some strange and peculiar effects in the course of your 
investigation. 

Level 2 — Rooms 

Room 1— The small foyer of the cottage of Merlis the Mage. A pale, greenish 
light emanates from nowhere in particular, and the walls are decorated with 
arcane symbols and spooky magical stuff that no doubt maintain Merlis* image 
but don't impress you. Much. 

Room 2— A long, narrow hallway filled with remarkably lifelike sculptures of men 
and beasts. Paintings of the village— strangely distorted but oddly vivid— hang on 
the wall. The scenes seem to move when you are not looking at them. Sounds 
you cannot identify emanate from the walls. 

Rooms 3-5— The corridor widens into a large reception area with many 
doorways. The chairs— seats for those waiting for an appointment in Merlis' 
magic hall — have seen much use. 

Room 6— Merlis' den. A desk is covered with scrolls and magical paraphernalia, 
and the shelves are lined with dusty tomes. The apparatus looks so dangerous 
and the runes and symbols so forbidding, you are afraid to go near most of the 
stuff. However, out in the open is an ordinary chest. 

Room 7— A laboratory. There are many bottles and jugs you are afraid to touch 
arid some complicated machinery. There is a small crack in one wall near the 
ceiling and a door on the east side. Over the door a sign warns, "DANGER- 
DO NOT ENTER." 

Room 8— The crack leads to a huge nest and landing area on the roof of the 
cottage. It is not visible from below. The large flying creature— evidently one of 
Merlis' strange animal friends— that usually occupies the area is not here. 
Looking around, you see what looks like a large egg to one side. 

Room 9— Another laboratory. This one is filled with cages of small animals. A 
sign reads: "PLEASE LEAVE OR YOU MAY SCARE THE EXPERIMENTAL 
ANIMALS TO DEATH!" 

Rooms 10-11 — Merlis' hall of magic. A large table occupies the center of this 
dimly lit room. There is a chest in one corner and a huge tapestry covering the

back wall. While moving around through the room, things appear to shimmer 
every now and then; you suspect there may be more here than meets the eye. 
Room 12— A back room in the cottage. There is a door leading out the back of 
the house into a forest. There are some empty phials on the floor of the otherwise 
tidy room. 

Rooms 13-17— A path leading from the back door through the woods. It is 
bounded by large, old trees and tall hedges; the shade of the forest is deep. A 
buzzing sound grows louder as you go east. 

Room 18— A small meadow in the woods, completely enclosed by trees. The 
smell of clover is strong, and a large, white box hums with activity to the south. 

Room 19— The narrow closet is lined with shelves on which rest various strange 
objects. You find your courage beginning to desert you and wonder if there is 
really anything here worth the risk. Perhaps you'll find something . . . 
Roms 20-21— An enchanted hall in which Merlis keeps his cats. The carpeting is 
expensive but covered with hair, and the room is finely decorated with chairs and 
tables of fine workmanship. There is a chest near one wall. 

Level 2 — Traps 

CROSSBOW TRAP— From high in a tree comes a loud "SPROINGGG!" but 
nothing else. Originally intended to keep unwanted visitors out, this useless trap 
was fortunately forgotten. No one even bothered to put an arrow in it. 

Level 2 — Treasures 

701— In an elegant chest adorned with feline figurines you find 250 silver pieces. 

T02— These insects must be magical indeed to produce such a delicious and 
tasty liquid. Drinking some makes you feel marvelous, and you risk a sting or two 
to grab a honeycomb full of the stuff. 

703— Hanging on a tree is a quiver with some interesting arrows in it. 

T04— In a brass-bound chest you find 500 copper pieces. 

T05— You decide to show Merlis a thing or two and take what you are sure is a 
magic wand. Unfortunately, it is so magical that it turns into an ordinary stick as 
soon as you take it out of the cottage. 

706— When you open the chest, you find the only things inside were moths. 

707— Inside a silver-inlaid chest that seems magically bonded to the floor, you 
find 100 gold pieces. 

T20— A large eggshell— of value only to a large egg.

Level 3 

Olias' Cellar 

Rooms, Traps, Treasures 

Level 3 — Rooms 

Rooms 1-2— A forest near the castle of Olias the dwarf. You are surrounded by 
the sights and sounds of the great outdoors: dappled sunlight, the fluting of 
birdsong, the trickling of a distant brook. Nearer to hand, there is an annoying 
hum in the air and the smell of something unpleasant. 

Rooms 3-4— A well-traveled courtyard in front of the castle. The dust is 
criss-crossed with tracks of horses and small animals. The gate of the castle to 
the north is closed and solidly barred. Olias may have taken your one and only 
magic sword, but a frontal assault is out of the question. A more discrete 
approach is called for. Fortunately, you have heard rumor of a cave complex 
underneath the castle that Olias uses as a cellar and storehouse. Unfortunately, 
you have no idea how to get into it. There is an old and rickety shed to the south^ 
but it does not look enticing. Still ... 

Room 5— Well, well. This may be the cave entrance you were looking for. It's 
dark in here, but there appears to be an opening across from you, and there may 
be a cleft to the north, near a pile of loose rocks. 

Room 6— The dark shed is full of junk, but there may be something worthwhile in 
all this. Watch your step, though. 

Room 7— A huge, drafty cavern with a man-made (or dwarf-wrought) door at 
one end. 

Room 8— A hidden arsenal. On the far side of the room you see a quiver filled 
with arrows. 

Room 9— Another cavern, the corpse of another adventurer, and another 
quiver. Also a minor obstacle. 

Rooms 10-13— These passages connect several large caverns. They are narrow, 
dim, dank, and a bit drafty. 

Room 14— Bat City. The cave-in that sealed the entrance to this large cavern 
also seems to have awakened about a zillion bats, which are now filling the air 
with their winged bodies and eerie, screeching cries. There may be another way 
out near a pile of rocks on the other side of the cavern. Protruding from beneath 
the pile is a skeletal arm gripping a sword. 

Room 15— Among the other objects in this storeroom is a sword that looks 
somewhat familiar. Could it be yours, lost on a previous adventure and 
appropriated by the greedy dwarf? To find out, you'll first have to do something 
about the snakes. 

Room 16— A cavern inhabited by particularly large and unpleasant bats. 



55 



Rooms 17-19— A series of interconnected caverns off a breezy passageway. 
There are holes and ridges in the floor; footing is treacherous. Room 19 is a 
storehouse of interesting items. 

Rooms 20-23— A long, winding corridor. There is a substantial breeze from the 
west; it grows in strength as you move in that direction. It whistles audibly in your 
ears, at least until a cave-in seals off part of the passage. (You are either clumsy or 
unlucky, or Olias has mined these caves carefully to discourage unwanted 
visitors.) 

Room 24— A small alcove. As you enter, dozens of spiderwebs cling to you. 
(Shades of Raiders of the Lost You-Know-What!) 

Room 25— Another alcove. What's that on your foot? 

Rooms 26-27— As this part of the cave widens, a familiar, pungent odor grows 
progressively stronger. You clevely deduce that this is the den of some 
furry animals. 

Rooms 28-30— A winding corridor that grows lighter and windier as you move to 
the south. 

Room 31— This portion of the cave shows signs of careful workmanship, as if the 
natural cavern has been deliberately enlarged. 

Room 32— This low passage slants upward. There is a light at the end of 
the tunnel. 

Rooms 33-34— These hand-hewn rooms obviously serve as a storehouse for 
some of Olias' accumulated loot. Your attention is drawn to the ornate chest in 
front of the far wall in Room 34. 

Level 3 — Traps 

PIT TRAP— As you are walking, you accidentally fall into a trap meant 
for small game. 

CROSSBOW TRAP— A crossbow quarrel flies from a hidden niche in the wall 
across from you. 

SPEAR TRAP— A hidden mechanism thrusts a spear at you. 

NEEDLE TRAP— As you try to open the chest, a tiny spring thrusts a poisoned 
needle at your thumb. 

CEILING TRAP— As you walk in the cave, the vibrations of your tread causes a 
large stalactite to fall upon you. The Surgeon General has determined that this is 
hazardous to your health! 

CAVE-IN— Whether an accidental falling of loose rock or a deliberate trap set by 
Olias, there are many cave-ins here. They may seal off an entrance or exit to a 
cavern or passage and, if you are underneath, may cause injury or even death. 

CREEPING CRUD— The exact nature of this slimy, amoebic life form is 
unknown, but it is large, hungry, and extremely dangerous. 



56 



Level 3 — Treasures 



TOl— In the quiver you find normal arrows. 
T02— In the quiver you find magic arrows. 

T03— An old set of armor. Worthless as protection, it might be worth something 
melted down. 

T04— When mixed with some herbs you happen to have, any venom you can 
recover from the dead snakes' poison sacs will act just like a healing elixir. 

T05— On the floor you find a Skull Ring with diamond flecks for eyes. 

T06— Three gold coins. 

T07— As far as you can tell in the poor light, the sword seems to be finely made 
and rust-free. 

T08— The sword is an ancient one made of bronze— an interesting curio of no 
practical value. 

T09— The shiny object on the ground is a fine pearl ring! 

T10— Olias is not the only pack rat around here. You find a collection of 
worthless beads of various colors, 3 gold nuggets, a leather pouch containing 
11 gold and 4 platinum pieces, 7 small diamonds, 2 small emeralds, a small ruby, 
and a large ruby. 

Til— On some skeletal remains you find a silver medallion. 

T12— A pouch contains 10 matching small emeralds. 

T13— The only interesting object here is a gold medallion. 

T14— There's more here than you can carry, but, being nearly as greedy as Olias 
himself, into the largest sack you can find you stuff 10 silver ingots, 3 gold ingots, 
a silver candelabra, 2 gold chains, and various minor bits and pieces (to fill up the 
cracks) worth another 500 silver pieces. 

T15— This is the creme de la creme: an emerald ring with a matching bracelet, a 
pair of jade cats worth about 2500 silver pieces each, a dozen platinum pieces, 
and a gem-studded, glowing belt. You have no idea what sort of magic it 
possesses, but you decide to wear it from now on. 

T20— A glittering piece of genuine iron pyrite of no redeeming social value. 



57 



Level 4 

Benedicts Monastery 

Rooms, Traps, Treasures 

Benedic, the wandering priest of an unknown god, has informed you that the 
once peaceful Gebite monastery has been plagued recently by an unearthly 
disturbance. The dead refuse to stay in their graves; in sleep, the monks are beset 
with troubling dreams; and some of them are becoming positively anemic. Many 
believe it a punishment for their sins, and the monks are unable— or unwilling— to 
deal with what appears to be the work of a powerful vampire. 

If you are up to the challenge, fame and glory can be yours! Also, if you want to 
be crass about it, you can have whatever treasure the vampire, its minions, the 
living dead, and any other inhuman monsters may have accumulated. Food and 
drink are yours for the asking; healthful herbs and plants from the garden you 
may take; and other gifts major and minor may be offered. These you may accept 
or decline as you please, but under no circumstances should you disturb the 
monks or attempt to steal their personal possessions, or the most dire 
consequences may ensue. 

You have been warned! 

Level 4 — Rooms 

Rooms 1-4— A large, walled courtyard covered with loose dirt and strange, 
glittering gravel. To the right of the arched entrance, there is a large stack of hay 
for travelers' weary animals. In the center of the court there is an immense, 
beautifully carved statue of a bearded man; he is smiling beatifically and appears 
to be offering you something in his outstretched hand. 

Rooms 5-12— A long arched corridor running along the west side of the 
courtyard. Many doors, both open and closed, line the corridor, but the only light 
comes from the barred arches fronting the courtyard. The stone walls are thick, 
and the air is cool. 

Rooms 13-20— Small cubicles or cells that serve as bedchambers for the Gebite 
monks. Each has a thin straw pallet on a stone platform, a small shelf holding 
various personal items (some interesting, some not), and very little else. Some 
are occupied; so, if you are going to investigate, do so quietly and cautiously. 

Rooms 21-28— A large, walled garden divided into long aisles. You are surprised 
by the amazing variety and abundance of plants, and at times you must cut your 
way through the shrubs and vines to walk the narrow paths. 

Room 29— A kitchen. The counters are covered with grease and dust, and what 
must be a month's worth of pots, dishes, and utensils are precariously piled 
halfway to the ceiling. A terrible stench is coming from somewhere. 

Room 30— A small pantry. The foul odor originates here. The pantry is filled with 
old, stale, stinking— no, reeking food. Would anyone really eat this stuff? 



58 



Room 31— The dining room is as much of a mess as the kitchen— or nearly so. 
Its sole inhabitant, the singing monk, is surrounded by crockery and an almost 
tangible alcoholic cloud. Falling off a bench without spilling a drop from the jug 
he's holding, he staggers happily toward you. Want a swig? 

Room 32— This obscurely placed room must be an infirmary or embalming 
chamber. Bandages and bottles of strange liquids litter the tables and shelves. 
There is a sign: 

OUT ON A HOUSE CALL. HELP YOURSELF TO 
WHATEVER YOU NEED, AND DONT GET BLOOD 
ON THE CARPET 

—Welbius, Monk 

For some reason you have a vision of a fatherly, white-haired man, compassion- 
ate and concerned but cheerful, and sense that there have been many miraculous 
healings here. Although the room is dark, you feel uplifted as you leave. 

Rooms 33-44— A long, narrow, winding spiral staircase taking you far 
underground. The footing is treacherous, the lighting bad, and the railing 
separating you from a fall into the abyss is cracked or broken. Near the bottom, 
you hear clicking noises and detect a faint smell of vanilla. 

Room 45— The stairs level off into a narrow, dank passage. Although the room is 
uninhabited, you sense great danger near. You can barely see the close walls, but 
you discern a very particular arrangement of bricks along the south wall. The 
masonry swings aside at your touch. 

Room 46— A large chamber of earth and stone. The smell of vanilla and the 
sense of impending doom are now overwhelming. Perhaps that tricky door has 
kept the native Apshaians from discovering the way into the monastery. You are 
not the first to find this room, however, for several skeletal corpses in ripped and 
smashed remnants of armor lie about. Near one is a particularly interesting 
sword, but unfortunately moving shapes can be seen moving in a dark hole in the 
floor. It looks like trouble in River City. 

Room 47— A long, dark earthen chamber with a heavy sarcophagus at one end. 

Rooms 48-49— A large cemetery adjoining the monastery. An eery rattling and 
moaning seem to come from the very ground. Many of the tombstones are 
ornate and finely carved, but some graves are open, as if the process of burial had 
been interrupted. One casket is adorned with familiar, glittering stones. 

Room 50— A large chapel or meditation room. Although there is ample space for 
all the monks to assemble, only one is in the room. He offers you a book on which 
to meditate. 

Rooms 51-52— Smaller rooms evidently intended for solitary meditation, these 
are ablaze with candlelight. A monk suggests you might feel better with a candle 
or two to dispel the darkness. 

Rooms 53-56— Narrow, enclosed hallways, dark but still peaceful. 



59 



Level 4 — Traps 

MOLD— As you rummage about, your hands and arms become covered with 
disgusting rot and mold. 

DUST— A strong breeze blows up a whirlwind around you; the dust stings 
your eyes. 

PU_ You fall into an open grave. Be more careful when walking through 
a cemetery. 

NEEDLE— Some of these plants have prickly thorns and needles. 

FLAME— It is only a minor burn, but you should not be so careless when 
handling a lit candle. 

CAVE-IN— Everything comes crashing down with a noise loud enough to wake 
the dead. The monks are not likely to be pleased, and you're just lucky nothing 
hit you on the head. 

Level 4 — Treasures 

T01— Among various peculiar vials, you find some containing a milky white potion. 
T02— An amulet of gold. 
T03— An amulet of silver. 
T04— An amulet of brass. 

705— Amazing! It's actually a find gold needle! 

706— Evidently you were hungrier than you thought, and this bit of stale bread 
looked the least old. 

707_What a haul: a silver candelabra, two silver chains, a diamond goblet with 
traces of a reddish liquid inside, 13 platinum pieces, 128 gold pieces, and 
666 silver pieces! 

708— This rough robe can't be worth much and probably belongs to someone, 
anyway. Put it back. 

709_From the rich earth you pick several large, white mushrooms. 
T10— A candle. 

Til— These herbs look unfamiliar but promising. 
T12— Another candle. 

T13— Some greasy, grungy pots and pans. Unless you're planning to become a 
door-to-door salesman or to volunteer for dishwashing duty, put them back and 
get out of there. 

T14— Apparently the Apshaians were not the only ones to know the secret of 
growing these lillies. Amazed by your good fortune, you pick a few of the 
healthful plants. 
T15— A crock of ale. 



60 



T16— It is a book called The Secrets of St Gulik. 
T17— An empty hand, that's what you are offered. 

T18— As far as you can tell at a glance, the sword looks well made. There is also 
lots of other stuff here, if you could take the time to get it. Unfortunately, you 
seem to be occupied . . . 

T19 — Some nice red, ripe tomatoes. 

T20— At first the stones look valuable, but you soon realize that they are only 
worthless gravel from the courtyard polished up a bit.

The 
Curse of Ra 

Monsters 

Cobra— This large, green or black snake flattens its head when angry. Its 
venomous bite can kill a man instantly. 

Jackal— This ferocious, dog-like creature scavenges the desert in search of dead 
or dying flesh to rip apart for its ravenous appetite. 

Tarantula— This hairy spider is found in dank passages. Its sting is not deadly 
but should nevertheless be avoided. 

Scorpions— Relatively large insects with nasty stinging tails, scorpions crawl 
upon the victim they are attacking and deliver many injurious blows. 

Wild Camel— Found exclusively in the desert, this typical, everyday, wild camel 
kicks viciously with its sharp hooves. 

Sphinx— The Sphinx is a large creature with the head of a man, the body of a 
lion, and the wings of an eagle. It is rumored that a human can pass one only after 
solving a difficult riddle. 

Criosphinx— Similar to the Sphinx, the Criosphinx has the head of a ram 
instead of a human. While attacking they are especially vicious, since they are 
able to attack simultaneously with their paws and their sharp horns. 

Gryphon— This type of creature has the head and wings of an eagle and torso of 
a lion. It loves to talk and will start up a conversation at the drop of a word. 

Ly nx — This intelligent creature of the cat family prefers an arid habitat. It has the 
stalking instincts of predator cats and the swiftness of a jaguar. 

Skeleton— A sword-wielding human skeleton, it is brittle and weak but attacks 
with a ferocity unmatched by living beings. 

Dust Wraith— A swirling vortex of dust surrounds this unembodied spirit. With 
amazing speed and dexterity to guard its holy sanctuaries, this unearthly creature 
uses wild magic to thwart any unwary explorers in their lairs. 

Giant Basilisk— This is an extremely large lizard-like monster which feeds on 
any flesh it lays its cold questing eyes upon and devours it without hesitation. 

Magical Statue— As you approach this large stone statue, it comes to life and 
begins to attack you. It cannot move but can wreak havoc with anything that 
comes within reach, instilling more than the usual wounds. 

Mummy— The sarcophagus springs open to reveal the most dreaded of the 
undead. This once-man is now only a dusty, cloth-enwrapped incarnation of its 
former self, but it is powerful beyond reason, relentless and ferociously attacking 
any who dare disturb its evil tomb. 



62 



Level 1 

Well of Forever 

Rooms, Traps, Treasures 

Level 1 — Rooms 

Rooms 1-4— You are standing in a vast desert. There must be some way to enter 
this small pyramid which lies before you. If the legends are indeed true, then this 
monument is the gateway to the fabled Well of Forever. 

Room 5— You found the entrance. In a corner there is a chest. A small tunnel 
leads onward and downward into the darkness. 

Rooms 6-8— These dimly lit tunnels slope steeply down, making it hard to resist 
moving on downward. 

Rooms 9, 10— These tunnels are steeper yet. You are slipping and sliding down 
the passages. Although better lit, they appear unused for at least a century. 

Room 11— You fall out of the passage a good twenty feet down onto a solid stone 
floor. As you recover your senses, you see the Glyphstone. 

Rooms 12-15— These are artificial passages which lead steeply upward and out 
into the desert. Around the edges are natural caverns formed by underground 
springs. 

Rooms 16, 17— These chambers are filled with fine spider webs. A small gem 
glitters in one corner. 

Room 18— Across this natural chamber, you can see your image in a mirror. 
Many slithering forms lie at your feet. 

Rooms 19-21— These are low-ceilinged caverns. It is damp, and various potions 
and ornaments from cultures long past lie scattered about. 

Rooms 22-25— Around you lies the vast desert. 

Level 1 — Traps 

Ceiling Trap— From the ceiling shoot small darts that have an irritation venom 
on their sharp tips. 

Dust Trap— Dust and sand blow around you violently, stinging your eyes. 

Needle Trap— A small needle coated with a weak poison springs out of the chest 
and toward your hand. 

Pit Trap— This is the Pit of Infinity. Quickly! If you can just grab the edge . . . 
(Better luck next time.) 



63 



Level 1 — Treasures 

TOl— A small naturally formed diamond. 
T02— Some normal arrows are in the chest. 
T03— The mirror is solid silver! 

T04— A golden Ankh lies on the ground near your feet. 

T05— This is a copper figurine of a small animal. It can't be worth much but you 
decide to take it along anyway. 

T06— This is it! The object of your quest, the legendary Glyphstone. You feel 
enlightened by its presence. 

T07— These potions in the strange vials appear to be perfectly good elixirs. You 
decide to take them with you. 




64 



Level 2 

The Sphinx 

Rooms, Traps, Treasures 

Level 2 — Rooms 

Room 1— You are in the desert directly in front of the Sphinx. To the east, you 
can see its entrance; visible to the north and south are its front feet. 

Room 2— You are still out in the desert but much nearer the Sphinx. The front 
feet now tower above you on either side. 

Room 3— Just in time! Right after you entered the room, a sandstorm started 
outside and covered the entrance. Looks like you'll have to find another way out. 
This large room has sand everywhere and no other objects at all. 

Room 4— In this large chamber, you see some traces of other adventurers (hope 
you are good at riddles) and a stairway to the east. 

Room 5— You are in a stairway, which leads up to the second story of 
the Sphinx. 

Room 6— This small room shows signs of wealth — tapestries, small rugs. To the 
west is a stairway leading down. 

Room 7 — This sparsely decorated room contains lots of empty stone tables and 
shelves. To the west you see a much larger chamber, lavishly decorated. 

Room 8— In this very large room, the walls are adorned with tapestries, fancy 
rugs cover the floor, and stone tables hold countless scrolls and other useless 
objects. To the west you see the doorway to a strange-looking corridor. 

Room 9— An object appears on the ancient floor of this corridor, although it 
does not shine. To the north a pivoting stone is across what may be a doorway 
to wealth. 

Room 10— You note that there is not much of a buildup of dust in this small 
room. To the east is a pivoting stone (exactly like the other one already open to 
reveal another long corridor). 

Room 11— What happened? You are now in a lonely (?) corridor with many odd 
footprints in the dust. 

Room 12— In this small room, the walls are decorated with plain pictures of the 
Egyptian gods. Exits are to the north and south. 

Room 13— This room smells of something, possibly some terrible beast. The 
only thing visible is a leather pouch with tattered edges. 

Room 14— There appears to be nothing at all in this room, not even a trace of 
dust. To the west you see a stairway that leads up to the head of the Sphinx. 



65 



Room 15— Another stairway. Going west will take you up to the head of 
the Sphinx. 

Room 16— You are in the head of the Sphinx, and many animal tracks crisscross 
the floor. To the north you see a stone on a pivot swung open to reveal 
a doorway. 

Room 17— The stone pivoted to close off the doorway. This corridor leads west, 
but you can see a doorway to the north leading into one of the ears of 
the Sphinx. 

Room 18— This is an ear of the Sphinx. Little appears to be in this room. 

Room 19— More and more animal tracks in this corridor which continues to the 
south. There is a doorway west. 

Room 20— This is the nose of the Sphinx. Sand on the floor and openings in the 
nostrils are visible. There is also a strange amount of cobwebs in the corners. 

Room 21— This long corridor has an opening to the south where the other ear is 
located. To the east another stone is pivoted to reveal an opening. 

Room 22— In the other ear of the Sphinx, you spy a small chest. 

Room 23— The corridor ends suddenly. This lonely dead end has walls filled with 
ancient cuneiform writing and hieroglyphics. The only exit is to the west, from 
whence you came. 

Room 24— In this dimly lit corridor, a profound buildup of dust covers the floor. 
Stirring up the dust as you walk, you see an exit to the north. 

Room 25— You are now quite sure that you have wandered into one of the front 
feet of the Sphinx. A doorway has been cut into the stone to the west. 

Room 26— You must squint now to see your way through the darkness and the 
dust stirred up as you walk. A bright light shines to the south. 

Room 27— Quite a shock to your dark-adjusted eyes, this room is very well lit, as 
if someone were waiting for you. 

Room 28 — Itjs suddenly dark again. Is that something furry rubbing your leg? 

Room 29— You have just gone into one of the front feet of the Sphinx. By way of 
some mysterious source of light, you can see a large pivoting stone which is 
closed across what seems to be a doorway to the south. 

Room 30— This dusty corridor evidently has not been traveled recently by 
anyone. It continues to the east. 

Room 31— The corridor appears to go into the body of the Sphinx. Continuing 
on is very enticing. 

Room 32— Seeing a large stone pivoted to reveal the rest of the corridor is a 
welcome sight. This corridor, you are sure, leads into the body of the Sphinx. 



66 



Room 33— SURPRISE! Immediately after you walked through the doorway, the 
stone pivoted across it and won't budge. Do you get the feeling that you may 
have incurred the wrath of the Pharoahs or some Egyptian god? 

Rooms 34, 35— This passageway opens into one of the Sphinx's back feet. 

Rooms 36, 37 — You seem to be in the backmost part of the Sphinx. The dust 
here is marked with several non-human footprints. 

Room 38— This is the other back foot. There appears to be nothing of value on 
the stone shelves set into the wall. 

Room 39— You finally find a way into the interior body of the Sphinx. You note 
with alarm that there are many non-human footprints in the dust. 

Room 40— Cobwebs cling to you as you walk this lonely corridor. Or is it lonely? 

Room 41 — A strange scent fills this room, and just breathing it gives you a sense 
of well-being. The smell is coming from a small pouch towards the far end of the 
room. 

Rooms 42, 43— This east-west running corridor has a goodly amount of non- 
human footprints in the dust. Best be on guard for anything mysterious. An exit 
to the south through a pivoted stone reveals a doorway. 

Room 44 — You are obviously not alone in this footprint-laden passageway. To 
the east, north, and south are doorways. 

Room 45 — Nothing of significance lies in this passageway. To the east, another 
pivoted stone shows a doorway into a chamber. 

Room 46— You recognize the strange scent filling this chamber. It seems to be 
emanating from a small pouch in the room. 

Room 47— In yet another corridor, you see a large room to the east. To the west 
you see another corridor whose walls are decorated with some type of 
hieroglyphics, possibly a warning. 

Room 48— A dusty platform dominates the center and back of this room. On the 
platform you spy some small shiny objects glittering strangely. 

Room 49 — Outside of the Sphinx, you have come upon an oasis. Lucky for you, 
you are very thirsty and need the water. 

Room 50— You can see the desert sands to the west. Some strange sense tells 
you that you missed something. 

Room 51 — A secret section of the Sphinx! Some shiny objects are visible at the 
far end of this room. 

Room 52— In this large room the sound of growling is almost unbearable, and 
you see the glint of gold. To the east is another stone pivoted open to reveal 
a doorway. 



67 



Level 2 — Traps 

Needle Trap— As you rummage through the chest of jewelry, you prick your 
finger on a poisoned needle. 

Flame Trap— Quickly and silently, a shape flies overhead and pours a pot of 
boiling oil upon you. 

Cave-in Trap— One of the stone steps under you crumbles, causing you to fall 
flat on your face. 

Pit Trap— Watch it! You almost fell out the nostril! Luckily (?), your fall was 
stopped by a sharp spear sticking out from the side of the nostril. 

Level 2 — Treasures 

T01— A very old and dusty quiver filled with normal arrows lies near the upward- 
leading staircase. 

702— As you travel across the room, you chance upon some mysterious 
Egyptian herb in a pouch which makes you feel wonderfully well. (When eaten, 
these herbs act exactly as healing elixirs.) 

703— As the panel shuts behind you, it hurls a pouch containing 2 gold pieces. 

T04— In a neat little pile, you find a silver offering tray and a pouch containing 
3 gold pieces and 1 small ruby. 

705— On a dusty stone platform lie a silver dagger and a small sapphire. 

706— A collection of gold and silver jewelry are found in the small and rotting 
wood chest. 

707— A small stone cabinet contains a sapphire ankh of the Egyptian god of 
darkness, Zukar, 2 gold bracelets, and a silver chain. 

T08— Aha! A small diamond, 3 gold nuggets, 3 gold pieces, 100 silver pieces and 
a diamond ring! 

709— A moldy pouch containing 2 platinum pieces, 8 gold pieces, and 200 
silver pieces. 

710— Could it truly be??!! Yes!! It is a solid gold statue of a jackal. 

Til— In the corridor you find a clay tablet with cuneiform writing on it. Don't 
even ask! We don't read cuneiform either. 

T12— Left over from the mysterious pot, you find a bronze ladle. 

T13— Too bad, you have no use for this broken chariot wheel (except as a 
souvenir of your trip to Egypt). 

T14— Some dust sparkles of mithril. Deciding to see how long it will last, you 
apply it to some nearby shafts of rotting wood, and it turns them into 
magic arrows.

Level 3 

The Pyramid 

Rooms, Traps, Treasures 

Level 3 — Rooms 

Room 1 — You are on a great desert looking at the pyramid. There must be some 
way to get inside. 

Rooms 2-22 (excl. 12) — Surrounding the pyramid, much the same as Room 1. 

Room 12 — This is your small tent, with your supplies inside. 

Room 23 — You've found the entrance to the pyramid! Before you are two 
tunnels, one leading up and one leading down. You decide to take the one 
leading down. 

Room 24 — You are following the downward tunnel. You can see a small room 
ahead and hear strange noises. 

Room 25— The snake pit! Maybe the other tunnel would have been better! 
There is a sword standing point down in the ground ahead of you. If only you 
could reach it . . . 

Room 26— You have left the snake pit. If you turn around now, you can take the 
upper path, but going east takes you out of the pyramid. The roof near the exit 
appears to be cracking. 

Room 27 — You take the upper path. BEWARE! You are now entering the major 
chambers of the Pharoah's tomb. 

Room 28— You see two doors leading off from this room. Hieroglyphs cover 
the walls. 

Room 29— This room, smelling of death, also has many hieroglyphs. You can see 
a small ring in a dish and a picture of Osiris, the god of the underworld. 

Room 30 — A long hall has murals and hieroglyphs all along the walls. 

Room 31— Another hall. You can see something straight ahead. 

Room 32 — The hall curves and you feel a slight breeze. The hieroglyphs are 
much larger here. 

Room 33 — The breeze is stronger. You can see a weapons rack ahead. There is 
a hugh ankh symbol on the far wall. 

Room 34— A small hall. Going north, you descend a few steps. 

Room 35 — A small room with many murals. On the far wall you recognize a 
picture of Ra, the sun god. The paintings seem to stare at you. 



69 



Room 36 — This room is well furnished with velvety objects and fabrics. The walls 
are bare of either murals or hieroglyphs. You spy a small talisman in one corner. 

Room 37 — This room has many cushions and beds, made of smooth, 
silky materials. 

Room 38 — There are many murals painted all along the walls. You spot 
something of interest to the south. 

Room 39— Racks and shelves line the walls containing many items of 
unknown purpose. 

Room 40— The entire room is filled with beautiful glasswork. 

Room 41 — This is a room with sand on the floor and a huge statue. 

Room 42 — This is obviously an embalming room. An open sarcophagus stands 
against the wall. 

Room 43 — A large altar sits in this comparatively small room. Hanging along the 
walls are ornate tapestries. 

Room 44 — Cryptic writing and hieroglyphs line the walls of this hallway, which is 
gradually descending. 

Room 45 — Signs of earlier adventurers fill the room. They include skeletons, 
broken swords, shields, etc. 

Room 46 — Statues stand along the walls. There is a faint beating of sand outside 
the north wall. 

Room 47— Sand lines the walls. The sound of sand beating the north wall is 
almost unbearable. In the northeast corner you spy a vial. 

Room 48— Here, too, you hear sand beating against the north wall. An animal 
bladder lies in the northeast corner of the room. 

Room 49 — A huge statue dominates this rather large room. As you enter, the 
statue springs to life. 

Room 50— Hieroglyphs and pictures line the wall and seem to suggest to you 
that this was once a magician's chamber. 

Room 51 — Another small room. 

Room 52— This room is filled with hundreds of odds and ends from centuries 
ago. A thorough search may reveal interesting results. 

Room 53— The floor is covered with sand. 

Room 54 — This room is bare of any objects other than some sand along the 
floor. You can hear a faint beating of sand in the distance and see something 
interesting to the east. 

Room 55— You are in a hallway. The walls are filled with ornate tapestries. You 
kick up some sand as you walk through the room. 



70 



Room 56 — You are in a hallway. 

Room 57— This rather large room has a very low ceiling. A huge statue suddenly 
comes to life as you enter. You also spy a shiny statue in the northeast corner 
under what appears to be a cracking ceiling. 

Room 58 — The extensive buildup of dust in this small corridor indicates that it 
has not been used for a long time. 

Room 59— This is a room filled with furniture of another era. You notice what 
appears to be a weapons rack. Maybe you should search it??!! 

Room 60— You see the sparkle of mithril near the southeast corner of this 
huge room. 



Level 3 — Traps 

Dust Trap— The desert winds blow up a biting dust that stings the skin, burns 
the eyes and makes breathing difficult. 

Cave-in Trap — A weak portion of the ceiling gives way and many huge stones 
fall toward you. 

Spear Trap — As you approach the door, it opens just wide enough to allow a 
spear to fly through and then quickly closes. 

Flame Trap— The picture of the sungod seems to glare at you for an instant. 
Suddenly the room fills with flames! There are no more pictures. 

Ceiling Trap— A very sharp sword was hanging, blade down, by a thread on the 
ceiling high above you. The thread breaks! 

Needle Trap— There is a tiny needle in the talisman which contains a 
mild poison. 

Crossbow Trap— A hugh crossbow comes down from the ceiling and fires a 
magic arrow at you. 

Pit Trap— A fifteen foot pit with a bed of steel spikes opens beneath your feet. 



Level 3 — Treasures 

T01— Some magical arrows lay in a cabinet near the wall. 

T02— A shiny and finely forged sword is thrust into the floor at your feet. 

T03— These are powerful healing elixirs. 

T04 — Some arrows in a small quiver outside the tent. 



71 



T05— You readily recognize this to be a skull ring, having certain powers over 
the undead. 

T06— On the altar there are three large rubies! They are worth nine thousand 
silver pieces! 

T07— In the chest you find 40 small diamonds. 

T08— This magic talisman gives you great powers to see and hear. 

T09— Inside the sarcophagus, you find a diamond necklace. 

T10— In the corner of the room you find five small emeralds, five small diamonds, 
and two small rubies. 

Til— Several scrolls are in this room. Since they seem to be in familiar 
characters, you try to read them. You fail, but feel truly enlightened just looking 
at them. 

T12— These are a large pair of spectacles. You try them on and somehow or 
another your range of vision seems to have increased. 

T13 — Gazing into this fine mirror, you feel better about yourself, so you continue 
to explore the pyramid. 

T14— This fine felt feels good around you, so you decide to wear it. Odd . . . your 
burden somehow feels lighter . . . 

T15 — You recognize this potion as the milk of certain snakes. It is used to 
increase a man's ability to endure. You drink it. 

T16— This is a beautiful crystal. Although it is only worth a few silvers, you 
decide to take it along anyway. As you pick it up, it dissolves in your hands, 
leaving you nothing but a tingly sensation. 

T17— You notice six gold nuggets in the sand. 

T18— You see eight gold nuggets on the ground. 

T19— You really struck it rich on this one! There are ten gold nuggets lying in 
front of you. 

T20— A beautiful solid gold statue. 



72 



Level 4 

Temple of Ra 

Rooms, Traps, Treasures 

Level 4 — Rooms 

Rooms 1-3— Open desert in front of a large carved-out cliff face lies around you. 
Objects strew the sand. 

Rooms 4-10— You stand in a large area at the foot of a cliff which has been cut to 
form a small canyon. Here stands a statue of Ra. It has been carved out of the cliff 
and stands 50 feet tall on two large stone pedestals. There are unlit incense 
containers before each foot of the statue. Underneath the large leg-like columns 
is a tall stone door. 

Room 11— This armory has many racks of rotting wood containing old weapons 
covered with a thick layer of dust. 

Room 12— These long walls are covered with detailed murals. Hieroglyphs 
depict men and animals working and building large structures. It seems that the 
room is devoted to the telling of the history of this land and of its many wonders. 

Room 13— It must be a storage room of some kind. It is filled to the ceiling with 
clay and wooden artifacts. 

Room 14— The dimly-lit room is filled with human bones. A dusty table in the far 
corner is covered with brushes, paint, and other objects. 

Room 15— A tiny sand-filled compartment. The thick layer of dust on the floor is 
smooth and untrodden. Strange! since the doors show much use. 

Room 16— The floor of this deep sunken pit is covered with the half-decayed 
corpses of several men. Then you notice the writhing bodies of deadly snakes— 
not many, but enough to have stopped these other brave explorers. 

Room 17— Another small compartment much like 15. It also has an unwanted 
occupant. 

Room 18— A natural cavern has been carved into a small ante-chamber. The 
floor is thick with a coarse sand. 

Room 19— More of the ante-chamber. You notice a rise in humidity and see 
moisture on the wall near the corner of the room. It does not appear at first 
glance to be water. 

Room 20— Going through a crack, you find yourself on a wide set of stairs. An 
outstretched body lies off to one side of what you are sure must be the entrance 
to the main temple room. 

Rooms 21-28— Very narrow passageways cut in the stone. You must still be at 
least 20 feet above the ground level, having discovered a door at waist-level. 



73 



Room 29— You are trapped! A stone falls to block the way you came. The 
gigantic room is littered with limbs and half-eaten carcasses of unidentifiable 
beasts. It must be the sacrifice area for this unholy place. A strong light emanates 
from an adjoining hall. 

Room 30— A bright light beams at the end of a short wide hall. An altar is aglow 
with a burning, blinding aura. (A fitting tribute to the God of the Sun.) 

Room 31— A small alcove just off the main hall, offering relief from the blinding 
light, but with a gleam of its own. The long-dead priests of this temple must have 
used this as a sacred worship room. 

Room 32— A short, wide hall. Near the end you spot a brilliant object shining 
with the radiance of the sun. It is protected by some unnatural force, which 
seems impassable. To either side of the hall are small alcoves. There must be 
some way around that invisible barrier. 

Room 33— Another small alcove much like 31. 

Room 34— The main room of the temple (you turned out to be right). There are 
many pedestals and statues, but one near the back of the room catches your eye. 
It stands taller than the others and gleams with an expansive radiance. The floor 
is smooth and dust-covered. 

Room 35— Another short, wide hall. 

Rooms 38-42— Imagine that! The thing is hollow with intricate and tricky 
passages leading up the legs and into the chest and head! 



Level 4 — Traps 

Dust Trap— The sand shifts under your feet, and you fall into a nest of 
deadly scorpions. 

Flame Trap— As you touch the altar, a severe shock runs through your body, 
leaving you weak and burned. 

Spear Trap— As you approach the rotting racks, a spear flies from one of them, 
catching you in the shoulder. 

Cave-in Trap— The narrow passageway collapses around you. It covers you 
with dirt and stone but does no major damage. 

Ceiling Trap— As you climb around in the small passages, a heavy stone drops 
from the top of the doorhang. 



74 



Level 4— Treasures 

TOl — Amid various other armaments which are unusable, you find some arrows 
still in good condition. 

T02— He won't need these anymore, but from what you have seen so far, you 
will: magic arrows. 

T03— Some broken clay jugs, probably worthless. 

T04— A large, silver offering tray. Polished up a bit, it should bring a nice price. 

T05— Water indeed! This fine liquid will come in handy to soothe whatever ails 
you. You stop to fill a few vials. 

T06 — Two small diamonds lie in the dirt. 

T07— A large, beautiful tapestry hangs over the doorway. The figures sewn into 
the fine fabric seem to indicate danger or warning. 

T08— You stop just long enough to strip this bag from one of the bodies. Worth 
it, too. The bag contains 40 gold pieces. 

T09— On the table you find a primitive book. Within it are examples of every 
hieroglyph you have ever seen. Practical, you suppose, but worthless. 

T10— At the head of the statue you find, embedded in the wall, with light pouring 
through it, a large ruby. OHHHHHH! It must be the eye. You remember seeing it 
from below. 

Til— A large gold statue with a bird head. Lifting it is a disappointment. It must 
be hollow as it weighs only a few pounds. You remove it from its pedestal anyway, 
and stuff it in your pack. 

T12 — WOW!!!! A diamond-studded platinum altar. It weighs a bit, but is well 
worth taking along. As you heave it from its low base, you notice a strange power 
surrounding you. It could have more uses than you first guessed. 

T13— A chest half-buried in the sand. Opening it reveals nothing. An empty 
chest; how cheap! 

T14— This is the carcass of a dead camel being ripped apart by these vicious 
beasts. 

T15— There is still some unburned incense here, if that's what you like. 

T20 — Just a pile of sand. You initially thought there might be something buried 
here, but it turns out to be a dead end. As you kick the sand around, you hear a 
hoarse whispering voice which seems to be cheering you. You can barely make 
out, in this part of the canyon, someone or something chanting, "RA, RA, RA."

TheL egend 
of the Apshai 

For more generations than any man now living can count, this forgotten corner 
of the ancient earth has devoted itself to Geb, God of the Earth. Into this place 
came the worshippers of Apshai, The Insect God, who laid claim to a superior 
sacred learning. However, dark rumors spread of the foul and sorcerous practices of 
the Apshai cult. The Gebite priests, fearing these grisly rites, lead their people to 
drive the outlanders from their midst. 

Fleeing south, the Apshaians were shortly halted by a vast, uncrossable swamp. 
Unable to go back to the Gebite village and unwilling to essay the perils of the 
swamp ahead, the High Priest of Apshai prayed to his patron for guidance. 

That night, as the priest prayed, a young brother and sister wandered away from 
the encampment. The girl returned to camp, crying, and said that her brother had 
fallen into a great, silent pit. Although deep in his meditation, the priest sent out 
a search party, but to no avail. The pit appeared bottomless. Nor had the Insect 
God given any solace or direction to the distraught priest. The people of Apshai 
knew not which way to turn. 

Yet at dawn the next morning, the boy came back. He had indeed fallen into 
the pit, but had landed on a shelf not too far below the surface, and there lain 
unconscious. Awaking after nightfall, he wanderd through many chambers until he 
reached a salt sea. Too weary to go on, he collapsed on the sand. A light touch 
awakened him and he looked up to see a six-footAong ant. Despite his worship of 
the Insect God Apshai, he fled into the water to escape this manifestation. 

As he swam to the farthest wall of the cavern, he noticed the waters taking on 
a greener hue. A dim glow came from the murky depths, and he swam into the 
light. 

When he surfaced, drawing in great breaths of air, he rejoiced in the restoring 
warmth of the sun. As he climbed the rock face of the coastal bluff, he noticed 
that the water was receding. The clump of red seaweed that had caressed him as 
he swam out of the cavern was now hanging limply across the opening in the rock. 

When he heard this story, the priest fell to his knees in thanks. Their prayers 
had been answered. The people of Apshai had found a home. 

In the caves beneath the coastal bluff, the Apshaians plowed the underground 
fields and planted the strange crops which they knew would flourish in that sunless 
place. They hewed out new passages and reaped a harvest of gems and gold from 
within their new cavern kingdom. Their power was beyond question. Finally, they 
were even accepted by the Gebite priests, who were won over by the tribute of 
gems and incense sent to them every year. 

The Gebite people, however, grew restless and full of apprehension. While none 
knew the exact nature of the dread Apshai rites, sordid rumors spread, and every 
year young people disappeared. The priests of Geb were too pleased counting their 
new wealth to hear these pleas — besides, nothing could be proved. Without the 
sanction of their priests, the people prayed for three years while the Temple of 
Apshai was constructed within the cavern by the sea. They prayed for two more 
years while a plague of insects from the swamp beset them. And they prayed five 
years more, while the priests of Geb continued to burn Apshaian incense moss 
during the Gebite rites, even though the crops failed and animals were barren. 

Finally, the Gebite 's prayers were answered. 




77 



One day the earth shook. Stumbling out of their tottering temple, the shaken 
priests found the tumbled ruins of what had once been their town. Following the 
cries of the villagers, they hurried up the shore to the dwelling place of the 
Apshaians. Dust billowed at the cliff face and heavy rocks tumbled where the sand 
had been. The opening of the cave was closed. Apshai was no more, or so it was 
believed. 

Over the years the village was rebuilt, and the Gebite priests renewed their 
power over the common folk. For many years the caverns were seldom visited and 
Viever disturbed. Generations passed, and memory faded into legend. 

Then, during the reign of High Priest Nemdal Geb, a movement arose to 
excavate the old temple in search of the Apshai gems and gold. A noted engineer 
was hired, and the huge, ancient temple and then the ancient passageways, one by 
one, were cleared. The underground gardens that still flourished in the darkness 
were rediscovered, as were the shops, and finally the mines with their precious 
gems and minerals. Nemdal Geb decided to continue the excavation in hopes of 
recovering the lost knowledge of the Apshaians. This proved to be an ill-fated 
decision. 

Shortly after the fourth passage was cleared, whole work parties began to 
disappear. Soon no one would enter the fourth passage, and eventually the other 
passages and the temple cavern itself became unsafe. 

The Curse, as that's what it seemed to be, spread to the town of the Gebites. 
Strange diseases scourged the people. Soon merchant ships would not stop at the 
harbor, for fear of the plagues. Commerce, and the population, dwindled. The 
town was again facing disaster. In response to the people's cries, Nemdal Geb led 
the other priests of Geb and the strongest warriors of the town in a quest to end 
forever the Curse of Apshai. They entered the fourth passage, and none returned. 

And so the power and mystery of Apshai remain. Few enter the forbidden 
caverns, and fewer return. The Curse grows there, and only the bravest of 
adventurers can unveil that mystery. Only by plumbing the depths of the world of 
Apshai can the Curse be relieved here on land. And, it is said, stones of rare 
value and welath beyond compare still lie within.

Dragons on a Chip 



CP 



Did you grow up in the company of the Brothers Grimm, Snow White, The Red 
Fairy Book, Flash Gordon serials, The Three Musketeers, the knights of the Round 
Table, or any of the three versions of The Thief of Bagdad 7 . Have you read The Lord 
of the Rings, The Worm Ouroboros, The Incomplete Enchanter, or Conan the 
Conqueror! Have you ever wished you could cross swords — just for fun — with 
Cyrano or D'Artagnan, or stand by their sides in the chill light of dawn, awaiting 
the arrival of the Cardinal's Guard? Ever wondered how you'd have done against 
the Gorgon, the Hydra, the bane of Heorot Hall, or the bull that walks like a 
man? Would you have sailed with Sinbad or Captain Blood, sought passage on the 
ship of Ishtar, or drunk of the Well at World's End? Did Aphrodite make Paris an 
offer you couldn't refuse? Would you seek a red-hued maiden beneath the hurtling 
moons of Barsoom, or walk the glory road with "Dr. Balsamo," knowing it might 
be a one- way street? 

If any or all of your answers are "yes," you're a player of role-playing games — or 
you ought to be. (If your answers are all "no," you have either stepped through the 
looking glass by mistake, or fate knows your destiny better than you do.) 

Role-playing games (RPGs) allow you a chance to step outside a world grown 
too prosaic for magic and monsters, doomed cities and damsels in distress . . . and 
enter instead a universe in which only quick wit, the strength of your sword arm, 
and a strangely carved talisman around your neck may be the only things 
separating you from a pharaoh's treasure — or the mandibles of a giant mantis. 

The standard (non-computer) role-playing game is not, in its commercial 
incarnation, much more than a rulebook — a set of guidelines a person uses to 
create a world colored by myth and legend, populated by brawny heroes, skilled 
swordsmen, skulking thieves, cunning wizards, hardy Amazons, and comely 
wenches, and filled with cursed treasures, spell-forged blades, flying carpets, rings 
of power, loathsome beasts, dark towers, and cities that stood in the Thousand 
Nights and a Night if not The Outline of History. 

Role-playing games are not so much "played" as they- are experienced. Instead of 
manipulating an army of chessmen about an abstract but visible board, or following 
a single piece around and around a well-defined track, collecting $200 every time 
you pass GO, in RPGs you venture into an essentially unknown world with a 
single piece — your alter ego for the game, a character at home in a world of 
demons and darkness, dragons and dwarves. You see with the eyes of your 



79 



character a scene described by the "author" of the adventure — and no more. 

There is no board in view, no chance squares to inspect; the imaginary 
landscape exists only in the notebooks of the world's creator (commonly called a 
referee or dunjonmaster) and, gradually, in the imaginations of your fellow players. 
As you set off in quest of fame and fortune in company with those other 
player/characters, you are both a character in and a reader of an epic you are 
helping to create. Your character does whatever you wish him to do, subject to his 
human (or near-human) capabilities and the vagaries of chance. Fight, flee, or 
parley; take the high road or low: the choice is yours. You may climb a mountain 
or go around it, but since at the top may be a rock, a roc's egg, or a roc, you can 
find challenge and conflict without fighting with your fellow players, who are 
usually (in several senses) in the same boat. 

Role-playing games can (and often do) become, for both you and your character, 
a way of life. Your character does not stop existing at the end of a game session; 
normally, you use the same character again and again until he dies for a final time 
and cannot be brought back to life by even the sorcerous means typically available. 
In the meantime, he will have grown richer on the treasure he (you) has 
accumulated from adventure to adventure, may have purchased new and better 
equipment, won magic weapons to help him fight better or protective devices to 
keep him safe. As he gains experience from his adventures, he grows in power, 
strength, and skill — although the mechanics and terminology of this process vary 
greatly from one set of rules to another. Aside from keeping a running total of 
"experience points" from one adventure to another, you need not concern yourself 
much with this, since in DUNJONQUEST the computer will make the necessary 
adjustments to your character. 

Ordinary role-playing games require a group of reasonably experienced players, 
an imaginative and knowledgeable referee/dunjonmaster willing to put in the 
tremendous amount to time necessary to construct a functioning fantasy world, and 
large chunks of playing time, since the usual game session lasts four to eight hours 
(although twenty-hour marathons are not unheard of). DUNJONQUEST solves 
those problems by offering an already created world with enough detail and variety 
for dozens of adventures. There is only a single character — your character — pitted 
against the denizens of the dungeon at any one time, but you can play for just as 
long or short a period as you like, and return whenever you feel like it. While 
there are greater practical limits to your actions than is usually the case in a non- 
computer RPG, there are still a large number of options to chose from. 

Much of your time in the dungeon will be spent exploring the rooms, searching 
for treasure, or fighting the hostile denizens there who are reluctant both to 
relinquish their hoards and to allow any adventurer out of their clutches. While all 
monsters in the dungeon are basically hostile, they come in various sizes, shapes 
and degrees of nastiness. While one creature may go down from a single blow, 
another may take a half-a-dozen and remain standing.

Combat, of course, is a frequent occurrence, and one of the central features of 
the DUNJONQUEST series is a combat system designed to mirror with some 
decree of fidelity the nature of sword-and-shield fighting. Hundreds of things might 
happen in a hand-to-hand battle: your weapon might break; you might slip in a 
puddle of blood or trip over a fallen body; a shield might splinter; you might put 
an arrow right into the eye socket of an otherwise nearly invulnerable beast. 
However, systems which attempt to allow for huge numbers of these possibilities 
are tedious at best and, because they almost necessarily overemphasize such 
unusual occurrences, are statistically as inacurrate as simpler systems. Historical 
research, a knowledge of various martial arts, and practical experience in the 
Society tor Creative Anachronism (a group ot medieval enthusiasts who get 
together in tournaments and similar affairs to bash each other about energetically 
with authentic imitations of the weaponry of the Middle Ages) have all gone into 
designing a system which, while simpler than some, is as accurate as any and far 
more authentic than most. Although you cannot, in DUNJONQUEST, succeed in 
chopping your own leg ott (which a particularly clumsy person might in fact 
manage), a great many variables of equipment, strength, coordination, skill, 
practice, etc., are involved in determining the outcome ot any particular Kittle. 

Best of luck, adventurer. ^.
